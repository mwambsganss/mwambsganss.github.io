AI Registry Frequently Asked Questions
Why do we need an AI Registry?
expand accordion
The AI Registry is a centralized database that captures risk assessment information about all Lilly AI systems.  It enhances transparency, accountability, and compliance with regulatory requirements. It also helps manage risk and ensures that AI projects align with Lilly’s goals and ethical standards.
What types of AI projects should be included in the registry?
expand accordion
See the
AI Registry Submission Decision Tree
Who is responsible for maintaining the AI Registry?
expand accordion
The Advanced Intelligence team and stakeholders from Architecture, Legal, Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Quality are responsible for maintaining the registry. They ensure that the registry is up-to-date and that all AI projects are adequately documented.
Who can access the AI Registry?
expand accordion
Submitters or Custodians can see their use cases by going to the
Lilly Employee Center Portal
and choosing More > My AI Systems Submitted for Review in the top right.
All use cases can be viewed by stakeholders and risk assessors (Prioritization teams, Functional group members, AI Technical Reviewers, Cybersecurity, Legal, Privacy, and Quality).

If you need access to additional reports, please send an email to
ai_program_operations_team@lists.lilly.com
.
When should I submit a use case?
expand accordion
The AI Policy applies to any existing AI use case not yet reviewed per the
Using AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure
and the
AI Registry Decision Tree
.
For AI products, chatbots, or tools in use, check the AI Registry
portfolio reports
to confirm your use case is properly logged to meet legal and compliance requirements.
See the
AI Registry Submission Decision Tree
If you are working with a vendor who is using AI and all of these are true, then no AI Registry use case is required (globally, except China):
The AI does not process Lilly data or provide deliverables or services to Lilly (except for business productivity tools*)
No model training on behalf of or at the direction of Lilly
No integration with Lilly systems
No Lilly employees interacting with the system
MSA / contract contains AI terms (either updated MPT with AI terms or full AI Standard)
*Business productivity tools
include general-purpose AI assistants like Microsoft Copilot, Grammarly, or similar commercially available tools that vendors may choose to use in their own business operations to improve efficiency, draft communications, or perform routine tasks. Vendors may use these tools at their discretion provided they do not input any Lilly confidential information, proprietary data, or information subject to Lilly's data protection requirements into these systems.
Should I answer AI Registry questions based on the current state or the intended final use of the solution?
expand accordion
Reminder:  Use cases are expected to be submitted to the AI Registry multiple times as the use case proceeds through the
Innovation Stages
.
Fill out the registry with (1) the intended purpose of the system (e.g., this system will be used for clinical trial matching and will consume X data at launch) and (2) the current stage of development (e.g., we are operating in a dev environment with dummy (green) data).
Stage = Alpha
Data Classification = Green
Data Processed = None of the above
Audience = Lilly Employees
Then when the solution is fully defined and ready for development for production use,
a scope change to your original submission
must be submitted
for review with updated information.  (See “How do I resubmit a use case?” below)
Stage = Beta
Data Classification = Red
Data Processed = Personal Information (PI), Confidential Information (CI)
Audience = Patients (Commercial)
Do you have any guidance or examples of "good" AI use case submissions?
expand accordion
Check out these suggestions:
AI Submission Guide | Tech HQ
When should I resubmit a use case?
expand accordion
The AI product has changed scope from the original use case (e.g., If you have a new intended outcome, data collection, increased data classification, expanded the audience, added geographies, or technology changes such as a different vendor, model, or platform)
You did not receive guidance from legal.
The AI product is advancing Innovation Stage from Pre-Alpha or Alpha to Beta, Early Release, or General Release. Please see
Our Innovation Stages | Tech HQ
for definitions.
How do I resubmit a use case?
expand accordion
Either the submitter or custodian should go to
Intake Form | ai.lilly.com
and click the Register AI Idea button towards the bottom of that page to get the Intake Form.
Then on the first question, choose the scope change option and select the system from the drop-down menu. Include as many details as possible about what has changed from the previous submission. Reviewers will focus on what has changed since the previous review.
What reviews are included when I submit my use case?
expand accordion
See the
Process page
for a description of the Reviews.
Who do I contact for each review?

How long will it take for my use case to be reviewed?
expand accordion
The review timeline depends on several factors, including:
The maturity and completeness of the use case submission
The complexity of the AI system
Whether a new vendor or model is involved
The intended users of the AI system (who and where they are)
The input data sources
How the AI output will be used
You can track the status of each review in your AI Registry submission record
or in the
Lilly AI-Registry Portfolio
report listing
, which shows which reviews are complete and which are in progress.
Please note that while you may begin vendor contracting during the review process, your use case is not considered fully approved until all required reviewers have provided their sign-off. Reviews are prioritized first by any approved expedited requests, then by the Prioritization field.
We continue to improve the
AI Registry process
to make reviews as efficient as possible.
How do I cancel or modify an AI use case?
expand accordion
Use the
Submit Requests and Report Issues
link at the bottom of ai.lilly.com to request modification or cancellation of an AI use case. Include the AIR number, title of the use case, and the submitter’s name.
How do I see the status of my AI use case?
expand accordion
To see the status of your submission, access the
Lilly Employee Center Portal
, select More in the top right corner, and then select My AI Systems Submitted for Review.
You can also search the listing available in the
Portfolio

Do I need to register a chat assistant created with Chat in a Box, an Agent created with Copilot studio, or something created with Claude to the AI Registry?
expand accordion
Claude solutions, Chat in a Box, and Copilot Studio Agents are GenAI productivity tools for Lilly employees that typically
do not
need to be submitted to the AI Registry process. However, specific uses may require registration and review to ensure compliance with legal and information handling requirements.
✓
See the
AI Registry Submission Decision Tree
✓ Submit to the AI Registry
if your AI Assistant will be used for sensitive decisions (e.g., HR recruitment, drug discovery, patient support, regulatory compliance).
✓ Only share with authorized users
- Grant access only to users who already have permission to access the underlying data sources. Do not share with unauthorized
users.
Why are we managing AI risk differently than other System Risks?
expand accordion
Many factors contribute to the heightened concern over AI risks compared to other computer systems. AI has immense potential benefits, but so are the challenges and risks, making it crucial to approach AI development and deployment with caution and robust governance.
Autonomy and Decision-Making
: AI systems can make autonomous decisions without human intervention. This can lead to unintended consequences, especially if the AI’s decision-making process is not fully understood or transparent.
Complexity and Opacity:
AI models, particularly deep learning systems, are often complex and operate as “black boxes.” This lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at specific decisions, increasing the risk of errors and biases.
Rapid Self-Improvement
: Advanced AI systems have the potential to improve themselves rapidly. This could lead to scenarios where AI systems surpass human intelligence and control, posing significant risks if not properly managed.
Bias and Discrimination
: AI systems can perpetuate and even amplify existing biases in the data they are trained on. This can result in unfair and discriminatory outcomes, affecting various aspects of society.
Security and Privacy
: AI systems can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation, facilitating cyberattacks, or invading privacy. Their ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data makes them powerful tools that can be misused.
Can I work in QA and PROD environments after completing the AI Tech review?
expand accordion
No, before going to QA or Production or processing data through a vendor tool, applicable processes must be complete. This includes all AI Registry reviews and any other company processes that should be undertaken, such as a
Quality Risk Assessment
, a
Cybersecurity review
, a
Privacy review
, and
WwTP
. Vendor contracts should include standard AI wording.
What can I do in DEV after completing the AI Tech review for my use case?
expand accordion
Once the AI Tech review is complete, you may begin development work using only green (non-sensitive, non-production) data in the DEV environment.
What happens if my use case was rejected?
expand accordion
Review the guidance provided by the assessor who rejected the use case.  If you are the submitter or custodian for the use case, you can make updates to the use case by clicking on the Intake form (go to
AI | ai.lilly.com
and click on the red “Register AI Idea” button at the top right of the page and choose Intake and click the Register AI Idea button towards the bottom of that page to get the Intake Form). Then on the first question, choose the option describing re-reviewing for a scope change and select your use case. Include as many details as possible about what has changed from the previous submission. Reviewers will focus on what has changed since the previous review.
In addition, submissions that have been Rejected or Deferred will be reviewed by the Tech Innovation Pipeline team for Innovation Potential.
