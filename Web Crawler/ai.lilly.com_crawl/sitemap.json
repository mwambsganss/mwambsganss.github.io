Submissions prior to November 7 will follow the review process based on the submission date. To use the new process, you can\nsubmit a modification request\nto:\nCancel and resubmit your use case\nRequest the Cybersecurity review be cancelled noting the\nSAE request ID\nRequest the Privacy review be cancelled noting the Privacy request ID.\nYour\nAI use case\nmay be reviewed for:\nPrioritization\nFunctional\nRisk assessment\nAI Tech\nLegal\nQuality\nDuring the Risk assessment review, a Tech@Lilly partner will work with you to evaluate your use case against risk criteria (based on data, context of use, system, and vendor details per Global Digital Governance Committee (GDGC) guidelines) and confirm the appropriate review path. Use cases that meet the low-risk criteria will follow the Low Risk Fast Path, requiring only the following reviews.\nPrioritization\nFunctional\nRisk Assessment\n* Quality reviews are only required if the AI is used in a GMP use case, if the AI uses continuous learning and the AI output impacts patient safety or product quality, or if the AI output is included in a Regulatory submission without 100% human review.\n** AI recommendations are supplemental and do not replace required company processes, including\nPrivacy review\n,\nCybersecurity review\n, and\nWorking with Third Parties (WwTP)\n. Vendor contracts must include standard AI language.\nReview 1: Prioritization\nWeekly review of new form submissions to determine next steps using the following evaluation criteria:\nShould this be done?\nIs the expected ROI sufficient?\nDoes this already exist or overlap with another program/product?\nDoes it align with business strategy?\nCan it be funded and staffed across exploration, design, implementation, and support phases?\nReview outcomes:\nProceed\n– assign priority: Critical, High, Medium, or Low\nReject\n– Rejected items may be resubmitted later with updated information\nReview 2: Functional\nA Tech@Lilly representative from the selected organization will contact you to:\nUnderstand the use case\nEnsure alignment with local strategy\nConfirm if the need is already met\nIf it's a new, high-value opportunity, the local Tech@Lilly team will partner with you to determine an appropriate path forward, which may include prioritization and potential funding. A local architect may draft a technical design to guide the next steps.\nNote:\nMany ideas spend a lot of time here due to strategic or technical alignment considerations.\nReview 3: Risk assessment\nThe Tech@Lilly lead architect for the requesting function connects with the submitter to fully understand the use case and proposed design.\nReview includes:\nAnswering key questions covering data processed, context of use, architectural design, and vendor contract details.\nVerifying and confirming all information in the AI Registry submission.\nPossible outcomes:\nFast path review cycle\nStandard review cycle (templated Legal guidance)\nHigh Risk review cycle (full Legal review)\nReview 4: AI Tech\nEnterprise-wide technology AI experts review your proposed solution to:\nRecommend the reuse of existing systems/vendors\nDefine architecture and models for new solutions\nIdentify and mitigate technical risks\nSuggest testing and monitoring strategies\nReview 5: Legal, and Quality (in parallel)\nThese reviews ensure your AI solution is:\nLegally compliant\nProtects personal and proprietary data\nMeets quality standards\nReminders\nDev work (using green data only) can begin after the completion of the AI Tech review.\nWork in QA/Prod or processing Lilly data through a vendor product cannot begin until all reviews are complete.\nReviews take time – your engagement makes a big difference!\nProactive teams respond to reviewers, clarify designs, and move quickly through approvals.\nUnresponsive teams delay reviews and risk missing key milestones.\nStart standard implementation processes early to accelerate the review cycle.\nWork with your CSQ representative\nWork with your\nBISO\nto complete the\nSecurity Architecture and Engineering (SAE) process\nComplete the\nPrivacy Review Process(lilly.com)\nComplete WwTP and ensure vendor contracts contain AI wording\nHave an Idea?\nIntegrating AI into our business is a team effort.\nAll AI use cases must be registered and approved.\nRegister AI Idea\nchats-fill\nQuestions?

It enhances transparency, accountability, and compliance with regulatory requirements. It also helps manage risk and ensures that AI projects align with Lilly’s goals and ethical standards.\nWhat types of AI projects should be included in the registry?\nexpand accordion\nSee the\nAI Registry Submission Decision Tree\nWho is responsible for maintaining the AI Registry?\nexpand accordion\nThe Advanced Intelligence team and stakeholders from Architecture, Legal, Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Quality are responsible for maintaining the registry. They ensure that the registry is up-to-date and that all AI projects are adequately documented.\nWho can access the AI Registry?\nexpand accordion\nSubmitters or Custodians can see their use cases by going to the\nLilly Employee Center Portal\nand choosing More > My AI Systems Submitted for Review in the top right.\nAll use cases can be viewed by stakeholders and risk assessors (Prioritization teams, Functional group members, AI Technical Reviewers, Cybersecurity, Legal, Privacy, and Quality).\nAI Use Case Reports\nPortfolio\n:\nHigh-level listing and summaries, and submitted AI Registry items\nOperational\n:\nMetrics for review teams\nIf you need access to additional reports, please send an email to\nai_program_operations_team@lists.lilly.com\n.\nWhen should I submit a use case?\nexpand accordion\nThe AI Policy applies to any existing AI use case not yet reviewed per the\nUsing AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure\nand the\nAI Registry Decision Tree\n.\nFor AI products, chatbots, or tools in use, check the AI Registry\nportfolio reports\nto confirm your use case is properly logged to meet legal and compliance requirements.\nSee the\nAI Registry Submission Decision Tree\nIf you are working with a vendor who is using AI and all of these are true, then no AI Registry use case is required (globally, except China):\nThe AI does not process Lilly data or provide deliverables or services to Lilly (except for business productivity tools*)\nNo model training on behalf of or at the direction of Lilly\nNo integration with Lilly systems\nNo Lilly employees interacting with the system\nMSA / contract contains AI terms (either updated MPT with AI terms or full AI Standard)\n*Business productivity tools\ninclude general-purpose AI assistants like Microsoft Copilot, Grammarly, or similar commercially available tools that vendors may choose to use in their own business operations to improve efficiency, draft communications, or perform routine tasks. Vendors may use these tools at their discretion provided they do not input any Lilly confidential information, proprietary data, or information subject to Lilly's data protection requirements into these systems.\nShould I answer AI Registry questions based on the current state or the intended final use of the solution?\nexpand accordion\nReminder:  Use cases are expected to be submitted to the AI Registry multiple times as the use case proceeds through the\nInnovation Stages\n.\nFill out the registry with (1) the intended purpose of the system (e.g., this system will be used for clinical trial matching and will consume X data at launch) and (2) the current stage of development (e.g., we are operating in a dev environment with dummy (green) data).\nStage = Alpha\nData Classification = Green\nData Processed = None of the above\nAudience = Lilly Employees\nThen when the solution is fully defined and ready for development for production use,\na scope change to your original submission\nmust be submitted\nfor review with updated information.  (See “How do I resubmit a use case?” below)\nStage = Beta\nData Classification = Red\nData Processed = Personal Information (PI), Confidential Information (CI)\nAudience = Patients (Commercial)\nDo you have any guidance or examples of \"good\" AI use case submissions?\nexpand accordion\nCheck out these suggestions:\nAI Submission Guide | Tech HQ\nWhen should I resubmit a use case?\nexpand accordion\nThe AI product has changed scope from the original use case (e.g., If you have a new intended outcome, data collection, increased data classification, expanded the audience, added geographies, or technology changes such as a different vendor, model, or platform)\nYou did not receive guidance from legal.\nThe AI product is advancing Innovation Stage from Pre-Alpha or Alpha to Beta, Early Release, or General Release. Please see\nOur Innovation Stages | Tech HQ\nfor definitions.\nHow do I resubmit a use case?\nexpand accordion\nEither the submitter or custodian should go to\nIntake Form | ai.lilly.com\nand click the Register AI Idea button towards the bottom of that page to get the Intake Form.\nThen on the first question, choose the scope change option and select the system from the drop-down menu. Include as many details as possible about what has changed from the previous submission. Reviewers will focus on what has changed since the previous review.\nWhat reviews are included when I submit my use case?\nexpand accordion\nSee the\nProcess page\nfor a description of the Reviews.\nWho do I contact for each review?\nexpand accordion\nLocal Functional Assessments based on supporting organization,\nclick here to view contacts\n.\nFor Specialized AI Risk Assessments, see below.\nAI Tech Review: Contact Malika Mahoui\nLegal Review: Contact Emma LeMasters\nQuality Review: Contact Rebecca Kitts\nHow long will it take for my use case to be reviewed?\nexpand accordion\nThe review timeline depends on several factors, including:\nThe maturity and completeness of the use case submission\nThe complexity of the AI system\nWhether a new vendor or model is involved\nThe intended users of the AI system (who and where they are)\nThe input data sources\nHow the AI output will be used\nYou can track the status of each review in your AI Registry submission record\nor in the\nLilly AI-Registry Portfolio\nreport listing\n, which shows which reviews are complete and which are in progress.\nPlease note that while you may begin vendor contracting during the review process, your use case is not considered fully approved until all required reviewers have provided their sign-off. Reviews are prioritized first by any approved expedited requests, then by the Prioritization field.\nWe continue to improve the\nAI Registry process\nto make reviews as efficient as possible.\nHow do I cancel or modify an AI use case?\nexpand accordion\nUse the\nSubmit Requests and Report Issues\nlink at the bottom of ai.lilly.com to request modification or cancellation of an AI use case.

However, specific uses may require registration and review to ensure compliance with legal and information handling requirements.\n✓\nSee the\nAI Registry Submission Decision Tree\n✓ Submit to the AI Registry\nif your AI Assistant will be used for sensitive decisions (e.g., HR recruitment, drug discovery, patient support, regulatory compliance).\n✓ Only share with authorized users\n- Grant access only to users who already have permission to access the underlying data sources. Do not share with unauthorized\nusers.\nWhy are we managing AI risk differently than other System Risks?\nexpand accordion\nMany factors contribute to the heightened concern over AI risks compared to other computer systems. AI has immense potential benefits, but so are the challenges and risks, making it crucial to approach AI development and deployment with caution and robust governance.\nAutonomy and Decision-Making\n: AI systems can make autonomous decisions without human intervention. This can lead to unintended consequences, especially if the AI’s decision-making process is not fully understood or transparent.\nComplexity and Opacity:\nAI models, particularly deep learning systems, are often complex and operate as “black boxes.” This lack of transparency makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at specific decisions, increasing the risk of errors and biases.\nRapid Self-Improvement\n: Advanced AI systems have the potential to improve themselves rapidly. This could lead to scenarios where AI systems surpass human intelligence and control, posing significant risks if not properly managed.\nBias and Discrimination\n: AI systems can perpetuate and even amplify existing biases in the data they are trained on. This can result in unfair and discriminatory outcomes, affecting various aspects of society.\nSecurity and Privacy\n: AI systems can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as spreading misinformation, facilitating cyberattacks, or invading privacy. Their ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data makes them powerful tools that can be misused.\nCan I work in QA and PROD environments after completing the AI Tech review?\nexpand accordion\nNo, before going to QA or Production or processing data through a vendor tool, applicable processes must be complete. This includes all AI Registry reviews and any other company processes that should be undertaken, such as a\nQuality Risk Assessment\n, a\nCybersecurity review\n, a\nPrivacy review\n, and\nWwTP\n. Vendor contracts should include standard AI wording.\nWhat can I do in DEV after completing the AI Tech review for my use case?\nexpand accordion\nOnce the AI Tech review is complete, you may begin development work using only green (non-sensitive, non-production) data in the DEV environment.\nWhat happens if my use case was rejected?\nexpand accordion\nReview the guidance provided by the assessor who rejected the use case.  If you are the submitter or custodian for the use case, you can make updates to the use case by clicking on the Intake form (go to\nAI | ai.lilly.com\nand click on the red “Register AI Idea” button at the top right of the page and choose Intake and click the Register AI Idea button towards the bottom of that page to get the Intake Form). Then on the first question, choose the option describing re-reviewing for a scope change and select your use case. Include as many details as possible about what has changed from the previous submission. Reviewers will focus on what has changed since the previous review.\nIn addition, submissions that have been Rejected or Deferred will be reviewed by the Tech Innovation Pipeline team for Innovation Potential.\nWhere should I go to submit a new tech innovation idea?\nexpand accordion\nThe\nTech Innovation Pipeline (TIP)\nand\nAI Registry (AIR)\nare now combined into one streamlined\nTech@Lilly Innovation Portfolio\n.

If you are unsure or have questions about data use with AI systems, use the\nPrivacy Help Desk Chat\nor contact the\nDigital Legal Office\n.\nIs Chat in a Box approved for CI and PI?\nexpand accordion\nYes,\nChat in a Box\nis approved for Personal Information (PI) and Confidential Information (CI). If you are unsure or have questions about data use with AI systems, use the\nPrivacy Help Desk Chat\nor contact the\nDigital Legal Office\n.\nWhat is the scope of the Using AI Responsibly at Lilly Procedure?\nexpand accordion\nThe procedure applies to any product that fits the definition of \"AI\" (as defined in our procedure) without exceptions. Teams do not need separate submissions for each statistical analysis run on the AI model. The use case submission should cover the general data types and purposes for using the AI model. Note: Any scope changes, including using different data sets, will require a resubmission of the procedure for review.\nWhat kind of impact can AI have on Team Lilly?\nexpand accordion\nWe are embracing AI as a transformative technology. AI will supercharge Team Lilly by allowing us to do our work better and faster. But we must all use it carefully and responsibly.\nAI tools are helping us accelerate drug discovery, speed clinical trials, and improve the patient experience by improving how we work – employing algorithms to automate mundane, repetitive, and time-intensive tasks to improve the accuracy and speed of many of our processes – creating thousands of hours of capacity for our teams to focus on value-added work.\nMany new or improved AI products will be released as part of our broader AI program. While some initiatives are specific to one group (e.g., scientists), others are for all employees. Our six-month beta release roadmap allows employees to begin trying out these AI products and provide feedback to help shape the future of technology at Lilly. Visit AI.Lilly.com to learn more.\nHow is technology – including AI – helping us to manage the best pipeline in the industry?\nexpand accordion\nTechnology is critical to our success as a company. In the clinical space, as our pipeline grows in size, complexity and value, the number of clinical studies is increasing each year. We are exploring how to leverage intelligent automation and GenAI to streamline and increase the speed of supporting our clinical trials.\nWe are leveraging a new AI-powered tool called Safety Automated Narrative Generator (SANG) to revolutionize the way Global Patient Safety (GPS) operates. SANG has the capability to automate the writing of patient safety narratives for regulatory submissions, ensuring our compliance with global regulatory agencies and that patients in need can maintain access to our medicines. When leveraged for the 250,000 narratives submitted by GPS each year, SANG can reduce the touch time for each case by up to 90%, saving more than $1 million annually and improving the consistency and accuracy of our narratives. This technology is one of our earliest applications of natural language generation and is an example of how AI is helping us work smarter and faster.\nWe’re also furthering the possibilities of connected clinical trial automation by licensing Magnol.AI’s capabilities to an external partner, ProofPilot. Magnol.AI is a wearable sensor data cloud that assists researchers with collecting, visualizing, and deriving critical insights from digital biomarker data. We have previously been leveraging this tool internally as a solution for remote data collection and digital biomarker development. But now, for the first time, this product will be used as a revenue generator for Lilly by licensing it externally.\nRead more\non LillyNow.\nWith AI, we have new opportunities to harness our data on a real-time basis to improve information dissemination to HCPs (e.g., commercial and medical affairs) and help create frictionless experiences for people to start and stay on treatment.\nDoes our AI adoption strategy apply to affiliates outside the U.S.?\nexpand accordion\nEveryone, including our OUS affiliates, can leverage AI by following the\nUsing AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure\nand utilizing these\nGuidelines for Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence\n. In fact, AI can be beneficial in cases such as\ntranslating materials into local languages\n.\nWhat should I know about artificial intelligence (AI)?\nexpand accordion\nAI is the field of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. Generative AI (GenAI) is the subset of AI focused on creating content as opposed to analyzing or predicting.\nWe continually develop new ways to apply AI and AI automation across Lilly, including new and improved products. We are grouping our practical applications of AI into four categories, with the first three as our emphasis:\nAuthoring\n: AI generates first drafts of materials and hands them off to you.\nConversing\n: You interact with AI in real-time to ask questions.\nCopiloting:\nAI operates in real-time alongside you, offering suggestions as you work\n.\nMonitoring:\nAI runs independently and flags a human when needed.\nBefore using an AI product, you must read the\nUsing AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure\nand utilize these\nGuidelines for Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence\n. Only specific public AI tools, such as Copilot with Bing, are Lilly-approved to handle Personal and Confidential Information. Do not put any Personal (PI) or Confidential Information (CI) into a public AI tool until you have confirmed that it is approved for that information.\nWe are posting information and resources on\nai.lilly.com\nand communicating through LillyNow articles, Viva Engage and email. We will continue to share information that showcases how AI can help us all work better and smarter. You can also submit a use\ncase\nidea via\nthis form\n.\nWhat are the ethical considerations of using AI in our work?\nexpand accordion\nWhile many GenAI models are trained on data publicly available on the Internet, some of that data may be questionable. Some AI-generated content\nwill\nbe inaccurate, so the expectation is that you verify the results. We must be careful to protect our intellectual property in using these technologies. It is vital that we follow the Red Book to demonstrate our commitment to integrity, and we are providing guidance that aligns with those values.\nWe are working to implement additional governance items that will further formalize the process to identify risks and position ourselves to continue working appropriately within our values. Continue to reference our Lilly guidance documents.\nHow does AI help Lilly accelerate reach and scale?\nexpand accordion\nWe are scaling our digital capabilities across the enterprise and applying the newest technologies to our vast data sets and scientific expertise. Our most powerful example at Lilly is what we refer to as\nmodel-driven drug discovery\n, utilizing GenAI with our proprietary library of millions of molecules and public data, enabling us to dream of new molecules and evaluate their potential faster than ever – at a previously unattainable scale. This will allow us to pursue more difficult diseases and biological targets and to discover new molecules that address serious unmet medical needs.\nAs we seek to accelerate reach and scale, we must launch our medicines globally – simultaneously. Traditionally, we would launch sequentially, starting in the United States, then Europe, Asia, etc. Another AI use case is using technology to evolve our intelligent content ecosystem strategy, helping us to develop and disseminate our marketing and promotional content to people faster. AI could also potentially accelerate our global claims process as well as our clinical trials.\nHow reliable is the output of Bing Chat, ChatGPT or other AI tools? Can we rely on the accuracy of the information?\nexpand accordion\nJust like humans commit errors, AI tools can also output erroneous information. This is a phenomenon called “hallucination” where a large language model (LLM) used to build the tool perceives patterns that are nonexistent to humans, leading the tool to create outputs that are flawed or inaccurate. While AI technology will continue to become more accurate as tools are refined, every user of AI must apply the same rigor of quality checks to the outputs from AI as we would with outputs from humans.\nYou can learn more about the benefits and risks of using AI by reviewing the\nUsing AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure\nand utilizing these\nGuidelines for Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence\n.\nHow should employees leverage public GenAI tools like Copilot with Bing? Am I permitted to use AI-generated images at Lilly?\nexpand accordion\nFollowing our guidelines, you are encouraged to find opportunities to safely and responsibly integrate AI into your work. Copilot with Bing is available on Lilly-issued laptops and iPhones.\nWe recently launched a beta version of a proprietary Lilly AI image generator for internal creative content. For information and guidance, refer to this\nLillyNow article\n.\nBefore using an AI-generated image, verify with leadership that it is appropriate for the task and complies with Lilly’s\nUsing AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure\nand these\nGuidelines for Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence\n. Always remember that you are responsible for the final output of your work. Reach out to the\nAI Team\nif you have any questions.\nHow can I determine the suitability of my use case and optimize tool usage?\nexpand accordion\nBefore using publicly available AI tools, please consult\nthis decision tree\nto decide whether your use case is acceptable and how best to use the tool.\nOur use of AI will impact our processes and people. How will you prepare the organization to continuously adapt and change? Will you be offering AI training for employees?\nexpand accordion\nWe will continue to share information showcasing how AI can help us all work smarter and provide employees with tools and technology to foster adoption and support through the change. This will be gradual; it will not happen overnight.\nTraining will be developed to educate and upskill Lilly employees. Tech@Lilly is also working to make sure training is part of large-scale rollouts. In the meantime, we encourage employees to try out the product available adhering to the\nUsing AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure\nand utilizing these\nGuidelines for Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence\n.\nHow can leaders empower teams to get upskilled on AI tools?\nexpand accordion\nWe have an ambitious agenda for AI at Lilly. To help with employee awareness and adoption of AI products, Ieaders should consider the following:\nEstablish the right AI culture:\nCreate an environment that encourages learning and innovation around AI. This can involve fostering a growth mindset, promoting curiosity, and providing opportunities for employees to safely explore and experiment with AI technologies.\nIdentify AI skill gaps:\nAnalyze your team’s current skillsets and identify areas where improvement is needed in AI adoption. This can help prioritize the skills to focus on and ensure that upskilling efforts are targeted and effective.\nEducate on prompt criteria:\nPrompts are the language of AI, ensure your team has the right resources to write effective prompts to maximize their experience using AI tools.\nRecognize upskilling efforts:\nRecognize employees who actively engage in AI-related upskilling activities.\nAs leadership understandably extols the significant gains made with AI, what are we doing to ensure we do not let bias and exclusion creep into our data? How are we ensuring equity and inclusion in AI-generated content?\nexpand accordion\nIt is important to note that every model will have some form of bias, so we will continually work to reduce it. New models that use any information about humans are evaluated as part of our AI governance process.\nWe also encourage employees to thoroughly review AI output for bias and accuracy. We are early in the learning curve for the use of AI, and through your feedback, you are helping to shape the future of AI at Lilly.\nWe share your desire to not have bias in our tool results, but it is recognized that AI models must be fine-tuned, as the data sources that feed tools are imperfect.\nHow are we ensuring that this technology is good for business while complying with all regulatory authorities? What are the potential risks to the company that we should all be aware of?\nexpand accordion\nAI has many benefits, but if misused, it can create inaccurate, biased, or harmful results. It can also put privacy and intellectual property rights at risk.\nAdditionally, to ensure that the public AI we’re utilizing or the proprietary AI we’re developing is good for the business while being compliant with all regulatory and legal authorities governing our industry, we are working to create an Accountable AI policy that includes clear expectations for appropriate use of these technologies.\nFor more information, refer to the\nUsing AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure\nand\nGuidelines for Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence\n.\nWhere can employees find guidance on testing and verifying AI outputs?\nexpand accordion\nEmployees can refer to internal\ntraining materials\nand\nguidelines\non AI usage, which provide specific recommendations for testing, verifying, and ensuring the reliability of AI outputs in different operational contexts.\nWhat are the dos and don’ts when using public AI tools?\nexpand accordion\nAI presents unique risks and limitations to be used responsibly and effectively. We must protect the\nConfidential Information(CI)\n,\nPersonal Information(PI)\n, intellectual property, and reputation of our Company by following these dos and don’ts:\nDo\nDo engage and ask questions when unsure of appropriate AI use.\nDo verify outputs of AI for accuracy.\nDo know the data sources, including biases and limitations.\nDo get help on AI contracts.\nDon’t\nDon’t use public AI tools outside of these guidelines to make logical decisions about low-risk use.\nDon’t put in personal or confidential information unless approved by Lilly (e.g., Copilot with Bing is approved).\nDon’t put intellectual property at risk.\nDon’t enter into paid AI license agreements for company use.\nWhat are the guidelines for using AI image generation at Lilly?\nexpand accordion\nWhen using AI to generate images for your work at Lilly, you must follow guidance on how to use and label these images. Make sure to read\nLilly Guidelines for Use of AI-Generated Media (Image, Video, Audio)\nbefore using AI imagery.\nHow does AI affect healthcare, and what precautions should be taken?\nexpand accordion\nAI holds tremendous promise for the future of healthcare. Because of the sensitive and important nature of our work, there are additional considerations to make before using AI. Learn more about how AI can impact our industry and the special precautions we must take by accessing\nthis link\n.\nWhat are the validation requirements for AI projects?\nexpand accordion\nPlease access\nLQP302-30\n: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) Computer System Validation for requirements.\nWhat does leadership expect from me when it comes to AI? Will AI take my job?\nexpand accordion\nThe most significant risk we face when it comes to AI is doing nothing at all. These tools are here to make your lives easier and free up your time to do higher-level thinking – so take advantage of them! With the world of GenAI, we no longer have to start with a blank page: have the machine generate a first draft, and you become the editor. This will require a shift in mindset and approach and will take time. The best thing you can do is explore how the tools can work for you and share learnings back with your teammates.\nHow do we ensure we have the right data pipeline to build an “AI Factory” at Lilly?\nexpand accordion\nThe AI and Enterprise Data Teams as well as others are working closely together on the foundational set of capabilities that will begin to form the \"AI Factory\". The Enterprise Data Backbone (EDB) is a key component for GenAI models to execute against. Getting high-quality data into the EDB is essential. Data that are accessible and consumable via the Marketplace (data.lilly.com) helps enable AI use cases and ensures we have the \"right data\" for a particular use case.\nAre there scenarios where you’re considering an AI solution but haven’t fully defined the requirements?\nexpand accordion\nCollaborate with your local Tech@Lilly resource to submit your idea to the\nTechnical Innovation Pipeline\n.\nDoes your Tech@Lilly team require access to an AI platform sandbox?\nexpand accordion\nComplete and submit the\nAI Hub Sandbox Request form\nto request Azure OpenAI sandbox access.\nWhen should AI usage be disclosed?\nexpand accordion\nIn general, employees should disclose their use of AI unless it is an ancillary or productivity tool such as Copilot with Bing, Copilot for M365, or LillyTranslate. Individuals can use these tools to draft emails, translate documents, or use AI copiloting for internal documents and presentations. All other uses of AI tools should be disclosed.\nCan you provide examples of when disclosure is necessary?\nexpand accordion\nDisclosing\nthe use of AI\nis necessary for any AI-generated content intended for external audiences, including marketing materials, publications, and social media posts. Disclosing\nan interaction with AI\nis necessary if you are developing or deploying a chatbot, summarization and analysis tool, or other AI-enabled systems that provide output to users. This type of disclosure\ninforms users\nthat they are interacting with an AI system and are responsible for verifying outputs.\nWhat are some specific examples of when disclosure is required?\nexpand accordion\nExternal-facing uses where AI-generated content might be employed include customer-facing communications, public presentations, and any content or tools intended for distribution outside our organization. Disclosure is also required internally if individuals use AI output to make decisions. For example, a chatbot that guides Lilly procedures requires disclosure to the end user that they are interacting with an AI chatbot and responsible for verifying outputs.\nHow will we clarify when disclosure is appropriate?\nexpand accordion\nWhen in doubt, disclose.\nRefer to the AI guidance on ai.lilly.com or contact the AI team at\nai@lilly.com\nif you have additional questions on when disclosure is necessary.\nWhy is there ambiguity in the current language about disclosure?\nexpand accordion\nThe ambiguity intentionally allows flexibility depending on the context of AI use. However, we acknowledge the need for clarity and will provide concrete examples to guide appropriate disclosure practices.\nWhat should I do if I am unsure whether disclosure is needed?\nexpand accordion\nWhen in doubt, disclose.\nConsider whether individuals outside of our organization will see the content generated with AI tools. If yes, disclosure is likely required; if no, disclosure may not be necessary. If you are unsure or have questions, contact the\nDigital Legal Office\n.\nWhere can I find more information about AI usage and disclosure?\nexpand accordion\nOur internal policy documents and training materials will provide detailed guidelines and examples to ensure a consistent understanding and application of disclosure requirements.\nHow will employees know when they use AI and must follow procedure requirements?\nexpand accordion\nEmployees should generally rely on system disclosures to identify AI usage that requires adherence to procedure requirements. Suppose the AI features are integrated into existing Lilly tools or are not overtly apparent to users (e.g., background statistical models). In that case, they are typically considered low-risk and previously approved by Lilly.\nWhat if an employee is unaware they are using AI due to recent tool updates or integration?\nexpand accordion\nEmployees are expected to follow procedure requirements for any AI integrated into enterprise-wide tools, even if unaware of its presence. Lilly ensures the system will flag any AI requiring disclosure when user awareness is necessary.\nHow does Lilly determine when AI use should be disclosed to users?\nexpand accordion\nAI use requiring disclosure is generally flagged by the system to ensure employees are aware. This includes scenarios where AI significantly impacts or generates content that may affect external stakeholders or compliance.\nWhat types of AI usage are exempt from explicit disclosure requirements?\nexpand accordion\nLow-risk AI functionalities, such as background statistical models or integrated features within existing tools, are typically exempt from explicit user disclosure unless they significantly alter user interactions or outcomes.\nWhere can employees find more information about AI disclosures and requirements?\nexpand accordion\nInternal policy documents and training materials provide guidelines and examples regarding AI usage and disclosure requirements. Employees are encouraged to consult these resources for clarity on compliance expectations related to AI utilization.\nHow much testing and verification should an employee perform before trusting the accuracy of an AI tool?\nexpand accordion\nThere are no strict rules, but employees should initially compare AI outputs with results obtained through their traditional methods for completing tasks without AI. They should do this multiple times to ensure consistency. Once confident in the reliability of the AI outputs, employees should continue to review results for any anomalies.\nWhat should employees do if AI outputs show inconsistent or outlier responses during testing?\nexpand accordion\nEmployees should exercise caution if AI outputs consistently differ significantly from expected results or show outlier responses. It's advisable not to rely on such outputs until consistency and accuracy can be verified through further testing or adjustments.\nAre there specific guidelines for determining when AI outputs are trustworthy?\nexpand accordion\nA practical guideline is whether employees could comfortably share their methodology (prompts used to generate AI outputs) with supervisors or the public. If not, it suggests additional verification to ensure the credibility and accuracy of AI usage.\nHave an Idea?\nIntegrating AI into our business is a team effort.\nAll AI use cases must be registered and approved.\nRegister AI Idea\nchats-fill\nQuestions?

Neither Personal Information (such as patient identifying information) nor Confidential Information (such as Lilly business information or trade secrets) should be used as part of any AI input without express approval from the AI Team, except when using Enterprise Lilly AI tools that have been specifically vetted and authorized for handling such data. Using Personal or Confidential information in AI prompts exposes the company to the risk that such information is shared or mistakenly depicted in outputs. See footnotes below for more examples of Personal and Confidential Information.\nPersonal Information is any information that, when used alone or in combination with other information, identifies a person (such as a consumer, patient, job applicant, employee, health care professional, or trial participant). Examples of Personal Information include but are not limited to: names, dates of birth, identifying characteristics (gender, race, marital status), SSN or other government identifiers, biometric identifiers, consuming/ purchasing information, education, criminal records, employment details, financial information, medical/health information, location data, contact information, and protected characteristics. See\nPersonal Information Classification Chart\n.\nConfidential Information is any information not in the public domain, such as information relating to the Company’s products, business, or activities, including but not limited to: trade secrets, product research and development, client lists, unpublished patent applications, existing and future product designs and schematics, pre-launch medical device drawings and models, unpublished financial statements and earnings release statements and related work papers, pricing strategies, manufacturing strategy information, policies and local SOPs and processes, user IDs, and organizational charts. See\nProtecting Confidential Information Global Procedure\n.\nConsult Third Party Agreements for AI Inputs\nAgreements to which Lilly is a party may restrict the use of certain information in AI inputs, particularly where AI is being used to modify existing media licensed from another company. If you believe your use case may be subject to a third-party agreement (including, but not limited to, patient consent forms, model releases, or terms of service for use of third tools), consult the applicable agreement and the AI Legal Team for guidance.\nBe Aware of IP Implications\nConsult the AI Team before using AI media generation tools to generate output that Lilly may wish to protect with intellectual property (IP) protections, such as copyright, trademark, or patent. Likewise, do not use inputs that Lilly may wish to protect with IP, or that are already IP-protected, without express written authorization from the AI Legal Team. Additionally, ensure that the inputs used to generate media do not direct the media generation technology to copy existing work or generate outputs in the \"style\" of others. For example, users should not ask for images of a \"dog\" in the style of \"Snoopy.\"\nProvide Transparent AI Media Notices\nWhen using AI to generate media for your work at Lilly, whether internal or external, please follow these instructions on the identification and labeling of AI-generated media. Remember that the general Lilly Guidelines for Use of AI-Generated Media apply to all AI-generated media.\nWhen AI Disclaimers Are REQUIRED\nAI disclaimers are required when AI-generated content could mislead viewers about\nwhat they're seeing, such as realistic patient depictions, treatment outcomes, or other content that viewers might reasonably mistake for real people or real results.\nThe key question when determining if an AI disclaimer is required is whether a reasonable consumer would be misled by the AI-generated portion of the content absent a disclaimer.\nAI disclaimers\nmay be required\nwhen:\nAI-generated media depicts humans (real or synthetic) including AI-generated synthetic performers in advertisements, identifiable landmarks, patients, or healthcare settings where viewers might reasonably believe the content is real\nContent could be mistaken for authentic images, video, or audio recordings\nAI has been used to materially modify media in ways that could mislead viewers, or where human modifications to AI-generated media could be mistaken for actual changes in a person’s condition (e.g., using AI to remove visible skin conditions or symptoms from a real patient's photo to depict treatment effectiveness)\nWhen AI Disclaimers Are NOT Required\nAll disclaimers are\nNOT required\nfor:\nDecorative backgrounds, abstract patterns, or generic settings\nCosmetic edits to actors that viewers understand are not real patients\nStock imagery-style content unrelated to product claims\nContent where AI use is obvious or doesn't impact product representations\nBase media containing humans or identifiable landmarks (e.g., the Empire State Building) that are not AI-generated and where the AI content is not used to modify the human or landmark (a notice may be placed at the bottom of the page or tactic instead)\nStandard Disclaimer Language\nFor unmodified AI-generated content:\n\"AI Generated”\nOr \"AI Generated [Image/Video/Voice/Audio]\" (for images, videos or audio content)\nFor human-modified AI content:\n\"Some Content Generated by AI\"\nOr \"Some Media Generated by AI\"\nDisclaimer Format Requirements\nThe notice should be:\nProminent and legible\nfor the intended audience\nIn clear and readable text and format\n(not black text on dark background)\nIncluded on the media itself wherever possible or immediately adjacent\nFor videos: overlay text, watermarks, or credits\nFor audio: verbal disclaimers at beginning/end, or visual notices when presented with visual materials\nMultiple AI-Generated Materials on One Page:\nFor pages with\nmultiple AI-generated materials,\nuse of a\npage-level disclaimer may be appropriate (e.g., \"This Material Contains AI-Generated Images/Videos/Audio Content\").\nContent Identifiers\nBuilt-in AI content identifiers (e.g., Adobe Content Credentials, Meta AI Info labels, Google watermarking) should be utilized when available but\ndo not replace required visible disclaimers\n, as these metadata tags and watermarks are typically invisible to users in normal viewing circumstances and only accessible through active investigation such as checking image properties or using specialized detection tools.\nReview Output\nRemember that you are responsible for the final output you use in your work. Before using any AI-generated media or content, review the output to ensure that it is accurate, conveys your intended message(s), and is not false, misleading, or unduly risky to the company. Using AI-generated media that resembles identifiable individuals, mimics the style of an artist or creator, or involves the depiction of children carries a higher risk to the company than other outputs. If your AI-generated media will be used externally, conduct a quick Google search to see if anything similar is found. If so, consult with the AI Office.\nRemember Our Reputation\nEvaluate outputs from an outsider’s perspective and consider how both inputs and the media they generate may reflect Lilly’s reputation. AI-generated media and content should not be utilized if their use could negatively impact Lilly’s reputation.\nComply with Other Applicable Policies/Procedures\nRemember to consult any Lilly policies that may apply to the AI-generated content and your intended use, and ensure that AI-generated media goes through the normal approval processes (e.g., Lilly brand guidelines, medical/legal/regulatory review).\nRe-Evaluate Future Use\nAI media and content generation technology may produce varied results even when the same input is used repeatedly. Thus, each output should be evaluated in accordance with the guidance provided above, even if the input has produced policy-compliant results in the past.\nRaise Questions\nIf you have questions regarding this set of guidelines or your use of AI to generate media, or if you become aware or suspect that media or content generated by AI and utilized in Lilly work product does not comply with Lilly’s or third-party providers’ (e.g., Stability AI) policies, immediately reach out to the AI Office.\nchats-fill\nQuestions?
