Submissions prior to November 7 will follow the review process based on the submission date. To use the new process, you can\nsubmit a modification request\nto:\nCancel and resubmit your use case\nRequest the Cybersecurity review be cancelled noting the\nSAE request ID\nRequest the Privacy review be cancelled noting the Privacy request ID.\nYour\nAI use case\nmay be reviewed for:\nPrioritization\nFunctional\nRisk assessment\nAI Tech\nLegal\nQuality\nDuring the Risk assessment review, a Tech@Lilly partner will work with you to evaluate your use case against risk criteria (based on data, context of use, system, and vendor details per Global Digital Governance Committee (GDGC) guidelines) and confirm the appropriate review path. Use cases that meet the low-risk criteria will follow the Low Risk Fast Path, requiring only the following reviews.\nPrioritization\nFunctional\nRisk Assessment\n* Quality reviews are only required if the AI is used in a GMP use case, if the AI uses continuous learning and the AI output impacts patient safety or product quality, or if the AI output is included in a Regulatory submission without 100% human review.\n** AI recommendations are supplemental and do not replace required company processes, including\nPrivacy review\n,\nCybersecurity review\n, and\nWorking with Third Parties (WwTP)\n. Vendor contracts must include standard AI language.\nReview 1: Prioritization\nWeekly review of new form submissions to determine next steps using the following evaluation criteria:\nShould this be done?\nIs the expected ROI sufficient?\nDoes this already exist or overlap with another program/product?\nDoes it align with business strategy?\nCan it be funded and staffed across exploration, design, implementation, and support phases?\nReview outcomes:\nProceed\n– assign priority: Critical, High, Medium, or Low\nReject\n– Rejected items may be resubmitted later with updated information\nReview 2: Functional\nA Tech@Lilly representative from the selected organization will contact you to:\nUnderstand the use case\nEnsure alignment with local strategy\nConfirm if the need is already met\nIf it's a new, high-value opportunity, the local Tech@Lilly team will partner with you to determine an appropriate path forward, which may include prioritization and potential funding. A local architect may draft a technical design to guide the next steps.\nNote:\nMany ideas spend a lot of time here due to strategic or technical alignment considerations.\nReview 3: Risk assessment\nThe Tech@Lilly lead architect for the requesting function connects with the submitter to fully understand the use case and proposed design.\nReview includes:\nAnswering key questions covering data processed, context of use, architectural design, and vendor contract details.\nVerifying and confirming all information in the AI Registry submission.\nPossible outcomes:\nFast path review cycle\nStandard review cycle (templated Legal guidance)\nHigh Risk review cycle (full Legal review)\nReview 4: AI Tech\nEnterprise-wide technology AI experts review your proposed solution to:\nRecommend the reuse of existing systems/vendors\nDefine architecture and models for new solutions\nIdentify and mitigate technical risks\nSuggest testing and monitoring strategies\nReview 5: Legal, and Quality (in parallel)\nThese reviews ensure your AI solution is:\nLegally compliant\nProtects personal and proprietary data\nMeets quality standards\nReminders\nDev work (using green data only) can begin after the completion of the AI Tech review.\nWork in QA/Prod or processing Lilly data through a vendor product cannot begin until all reviews are complete.\nReviews take time – your engagement makes a big difference!\nProactive teams respond to reviewers, clarify designs, and move quickly through approvals.\nUnresponsive teams delay reviews and risk missing key milestones.\nStart standard implementation processes early to accelerate the review cycle.\nWork with your CSQ representative\nWork with your\nBISO\nto complete the\nSecurity Architecture and Engineering (SAE) process\nComplete the\nPrivacy Review Process(lilly.com)\nComplete WwTP and ensure vendor contracts contain AI wording\nHave an Idea?\nIntegrating AI into our business is a team effort.\nAll AI use cases must be registered and approved.\nRegister AI Idea\nchats-fill\nQuestions?
