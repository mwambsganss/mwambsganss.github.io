Intake Form
The AI Registry is Lilly’s centralized database for tracking risk assessment information on all AI systems. It promotes transparency, accountability, and regulation compliance while ensuring AI projects align with Lilly’s goals and ethical standards.
This form collects key details about your AI idea to assess its feasibility and potential risks related to AI in Technical, Legal, Privacy, Cybersecurity, and Quality areas.
Note:
Reviews take time. The more complete and detailed information you can provide upfront, the smoother and faster the assessment process will be for reviewers. Timely responses to any follow-up questions from reviewers are also critical to avoid delays.
Refer to the
Using AI Responsibly at Lilly procedure
and the
AI Guidelines
for guidance.
