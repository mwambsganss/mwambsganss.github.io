AI Registry Review Process: What to Expect
Important:
This process reflects requirements for AI Registry submissions made on or after November 7, 2025. Submissions prior to November 7 will follow the review process based on the submission date. To use the new process, you can
submit a modification request
to:
Cancel and resubmit your use case
Request the Cybersecurity review be cancelled noting the
SAE request ID
Request the Privacy review be cancelled noting the Privacy request ID.
Your
AI use case
may be reviewed for:
Prioritization
Functional
Risk assessment
AI Tech
Legal
Quality
During the Risk assessment review, a Tech@Lilly partner will work with you to evaluate your use case against risk criteria (based on data, context of use, system, and vendor details per Global Digital Governance Committee (GDGC) guidelines) and confirm the appropriate review path. Use cases that meet the low-risk criteria will follow the Low Risk Fast Path, requiring only the following reviews.
Prioritization
Functional
Risk Assessment
* Quality reviews are only required if the AI is used in a GMP use case, if the AI uses continuous learning and the AI output impacts patient safety or product quality, or if the AI output is included in a Regulatory submission without 100% human review.
** AI recommendations are supplemental and do not replace required company processes, including
Privacy review
,
Cybersecurity review
, and
Working with Third Parties (WwTP)
. Vendor contracts must include standard AI language.
Review 1: Prioritization
Weekly review of new form submissions to determine next steps using the following evaluation criteria:
Should this be done?
Is the expected ROI sufficient?
Does this already exist or overlap with another program/product?
Does it align with business strategy?
Can it be funded and staffed across exploration, design, implementation, and support phases?
Review outcomes:
Proceed
– assign priority: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
Reject
– Rejected items may be resubmitted later with updated information
Review 2: Functional
A Tech@Lilly representative from the selected organization will contact you to:
Understand the use case
Ensure alignment with local strategy
Confirm if the need is already met
If it's a new, high-value opportunity, the local Tech@Lilly team will partner with you to determine an appropriate path forward, which may include prioritization and potential funding. A local architect may draft a technical design to guide the next steps.
Note:
Many ideas spend a lot of time here due to strategic or technical alignment considerations.
Review 3: Risk assessment
The Tech@Lilly lead architect for the requesting function connects with the submitter to fully understand the use case and proposed design.
Review includes:
Answering key questions covering data processed, context of use, architectural design, and vendor contract details.
Verifying and confirming all information in the AI Registry submission.
Possible outcomes:
Fast path review cycle
Standard review cycle (templated Legal guidance)
High Risk review cycle (full Legal review)
Review 4: AI Tech
Enterprise-wide technology AI experts review your proposed solution to:
Recommend the reuse of existing systems/vendors
Define architecture and models for new solutions
Identify and mitigate technical risks
Suggest testing and monitoring strategies
Review 5: Legal, and Quality (in parallel)
These reviews ensure your AI solution is:
Legally compliant
Protects personal and proprietary data
Meets quality standards
Reminders
Dev work (using green data only) can begin after the completion of the AI Tech review.
Work in QA/Prod or processing Lilly data through a vendor product cannot begin until all reviews are complete.
Reviews take time – your engagement makes a big difference!
Proactive teams respond to reviewers, clarify designs, and move quickly through approvals.
Unresponsive teams delay reviews and risk missing key milestones.
Start standard implementation processes early to accelerate the review cycle.
