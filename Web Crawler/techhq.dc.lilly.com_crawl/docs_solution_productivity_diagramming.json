These visualizations help to simplify intricate concepts, making them more accessible and easier to\nunderstand.\nDetailed technical diagrams and network diagrams\n​\nTechnical and network diagrams are vital for technical teams, offering a detailed blueprint of software architecture.\nThey illustrate system components, data flows, and interactions, helping developers and IT professionals understand\ncomplex interdependencies. Network diagrams show the physical and logical layout of network infrastructure, essential\nfor troubleshooting, performance optimization, and ensuring scalability and security.\nCollaborative projects and cloud architecture diagrams\n​\nCollaborative projects and cloud architecture diagrams are key in modern software development. They enable teams to work\ntogether smoothly, regardless of location. These diagrams map out cloud infrastructure, showing how services integrate\nand interact. They are vital for planning, deploying, and managing scalable, resilient, and secure cloud applications.\nCollaboration allows for continuous feedback and improvement, resulting in more robust cloud solutions.\nVisualizing and communicating software architecture to technical teams\n​\nVisualizing and communicating software architecture to technical teams involves creating representations that capture\nthe system's complexity while ensuring clarity and comprehensibility. This process includes developing detailed\nflowcharts, UML diagrams, and architectural blueprints that delineate modules, dependencies, and data flow. These visual\naids not only facilitate better understanding among team members but also serve as a reference during development,\ntroubleshooting, and scaling phases.\nTech Recommendations\n​\nPowerPoint\n: Use for quick visualizations, presentations to non-technical audiences, and adding diagrams to slides.\nMicrosoft Visio\n: Use for detailed technical diagrams, network diagrams, and complex process flows.\nLucidchart\n: Use for collaborative projects, cloud architecture diagrams, and integrating with web-based tools.\nC4 Model\n: Use for visualizing and communicating software architecture to technical teams.\nMermaid\n: Use for creating diagrams and visualizations using text-based descriptions, ideal for technical\ndocumentation, integrating with Markdown, and embedding in web applications.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nsolution-guide\nproductivity\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n🗄️ Team Productivity BLT\nNext\n🎨 User Experience & Design\nUse Cases\nQuick visualizations and non-technical presentations\nDetailed technical diagrams and network diagrams\nCollaborative projects and cloud architecture diagrams\nVisualizing and communicating software architecture to technical teams\nTech Recommendations\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
