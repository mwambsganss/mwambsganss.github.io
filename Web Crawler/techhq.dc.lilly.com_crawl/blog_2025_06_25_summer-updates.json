The TechHQ platform has evolved significantly with\nmajor additions to our AI architecture ecosystem, enhanced innovation pipeline framework, and expanded solution guide\nlibrary. Here's what's new this summer:\nThe highlight is the launch of our\nAI Architecture Ecosystem\n, authored by the EBA AI Architecture\nteam. This framework introduces a four-layer stack—Experience, AI, Model, and Data—along with reusable agentic AI\npatterns and memory architectures. We’ve also clarified our strategic AI platform positioning, with Cortex as our\nprimary GenAI platform.\nThe\nInnovation Pipeline\nis now easier to navigate thanks to a new Innovation Stage\nAssessment Table, helping teams define and assess the maturity of their work—from Pre-Alpha to General Release. Several\ncapabilities are currently in Pre-Alpha, including AI chatbot testing, automated test script generation, and mobile and\nA/V testing frameworks. We’ve also published our first Emerging Technologies write-up on AI video generation, comparing\nplatforms and outlining pharma-specific use cases.\nWe’ve expanded our\nSolution Guide Library\nwith new guides including Knowledge Sharing,\nData Visualization, and Document Processing. Each guide reflects our AI-first approach, with integrated recommendations\nfor tools like Microsoft Copilot, AI-powered test automation, and enhanced translation services. We’ve also improved\nlifecycle management\n.\nTo make all of this easier to explore, we’ve also made improvements to homepage navigation—so you can find what you need\nfaster. We’d love to hear what you think and what you'd like to see next.\nYour contributions\nand feedback help shape the\nfuture of TechHQ.\nTags:\nTech HQ\nEdit this page\nOlder post\nFebruary Updates Roll-up\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
