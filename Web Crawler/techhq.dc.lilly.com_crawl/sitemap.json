Our Reference Architecture exists to bring clarity, consistency, and\nalignment across that spectrum.\nIt’s more than a technical blueprint—it’s a thinking model that helps teams:\nUnderstand where they are in the solutioning journey\nAlign on the right architectural patterns\nNavigate toward the appropriate solution categories\nThis architecture is modular, scalable, and built to evolve—just like the problems we’re solving.\nUse Cases In Action\n​\nProblem Exploration\n​\n\"I'm not sure what my problem is.\"\n\"I know my problem and need to express it.\"\nThese are early-stage innovation needs. The architecture supports teams with tools for problem framing and collaborative\ndesign. These often lead into categories like\nAI & Intelligent Agents\nor\nBusiness Enablement\n, where intelligent\nsearch, automation, or knowledge systems help shape the solution.\nSaaS Integration\n​\n\"I've purchased a SaaS solution I want to implement.\"\nThis is a clear implementation scenario. The architecture provides identity, data integration, and orchestration\nplatforms to ensure secure and scalable onboarding. These needs typically align with\nCloud & Infrastructure\n,\nCybersecurity\n, and\nEngineering Enablement\n.\nAnalytics & Compute\n​\n\"I need high-performance analytics without specialized infrastructure.\"\n\"I need high-performance analytics with custom infrastructure.\"\nThe architecture supports both managed and custom compute paths:\nFor managed needs, analytics-as-a-service platforms offer speed and scale.\nFor custom needs, utility architecture enables tailored infrastructure design.\nThese use cases align with\nData & Analytics\nand\nCloud & Infrastructure\n.\nCustom AI & Web Tools\n​\n\"I want to implement a specialized AI solution in a custom web tool.\"\nThis blends innovation with delivery. The architecture supports this through a Dev Factory model with AI and web\ndevelopment specialties, and close collaboration with UX and business design. These efforts span\nAI & Intelligent\nAgents\n,\nUser Experience & Design\n, and\nEngineering Enablement\n.\nInternal Custom Development\n​\n\"I want to build a custom solution with my dev team.\"\nThis is a full-stack build scenario. The architecture provides DevX services, platforms, and API enablement to empower\ninternal teams. These efforts typically draw from\nEngineering Enablement\n,\nCloud & Infrastructure\n, and\nObservability & Reliability\n.\nThird-Party Integration\n​\n\"A partner needs to use our identity, AE checking, and consent models.\"\nThis is a governance-heavy integration. The architecture supports it through secure APIs, workflow orchestration, and\nbusiness services. These needs intersect with\nCybersecurity\n,\nCloud & Infrastructure\n, and\nBusiness\nEnablement\n—ensuring compliance, control, and auditability.\nTech Positioning\n​\nTech positioning is the strategic process of aligning technology (including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, tools, accelerators,\ncomponents, and features) with Lilly’s goals and business needs. This ensures that every technology investment supports\nbroader objectives, such as enhancing customer experience, improving operational efficiency, and driving innovation.\nTechnology Classifications\nWe use the following\ntechnology classifications\nto describe the maturity, adoption, and strategic relevance of\ntechnologies in Tech@Lilly:\nEmerging\n– Technologies or capabilities in the early stages of exploration and experimentation. These are\ntypically undergoing\nproof-of-value\n,\npilot programs\n, or\nviability testing\nto assess potential business impact\nand feasibility.\nSpecialized\n– Solutions that are\ntailored to specific use cases\n, departments, or business units. They are\nnot\nbroadly adopted\nacross the enterprise but deliver high value in their niche applications.\nStandard\n– Technologies or capabilities that are\napproved for enterprise-wide use\n. They are\nwell-supported,\nstable, and scalable\n, with established governance, documentation, and integration patterns.\nStrategic\n– Foundational technologies or platforms that are\ncritical to the enterprise’s long-term strategy\nand operations\n. These receive\nongoing investment\n, are\ndeeply embedded\nin business processes, and are\ncentral to\ninnovation, scalability, and resilience\n.\nDeclining\n– Technologies or capabilities that are\nno longer aligned with strategic direction\n. Investment is\nbeing reduced, and a\nretirement or replacement plan\nis being developed or considered.\nRetiring\n– Solutions that are in the\nactive process of being phased out\n. Replacement technologies have been\nidentified, and\nmigration or decommissioning efforts\nare underway.\nExited\n– Technologies or capabilities that have been\nfully retired\n. They are\nno longer supported, approved, or\nin use\nwithin the enterprise environment.\nProhibited\n– Technologies or practices that are\nexplicitly blocked or restricted\ndue to\nsubstantial risk\n,\ncompliance issues\n, or a\nformal enterprise architecture decision\n. Use is not permitted under any circumstances.\nTech positioning plays a key role in optimizing our technology landscape, mitigate risks, and minimizing the cost of\nchange. It is designed for architects and technical leaders responsible for delivering products and solutions and for\naligning technology with strategic business goals.\nYou can search and browse tech positioning records on\nLillyFlow\nusing the\ntech-positioning\ntag, which are maintained by EBA as articles. To browse records for a specific capability\nor category, use the following links:\nAsk your tech positioning questions on LillyFlow\nfor\nothers to reuse the answers.

Our Reference Architecture exists to bring clarity, consistency, and\nalignment across that spectrum.\nIt’s more than a technical blueprint—it’s a thinking model that helps teams:\nUnderstand where they are in the solutioning journey\nAlign on the right architectural patterns\nNavigate toward the appropriate solution categories\nThis architecture is modular, scalable, and built to evolve—just like the problems we’re solving.\nUse Cases In Action\n​\nProblem Exploration\n​\n\"I'm not sure what my problem is.\"\n\"I know my problem and need to express it.\"\nThese are early-stage innovation needs. The architecture supports teams with tools for problem framing and collaborative\ndesign. These often lead into categories like\nAI & Intelligent Agents\nor\nBusiness Enablement\n, where intelligent\nsearch, automation, or knowledge systems help shape the solution.\nSaaS Integration\n​\n\"I've purchased a SaaS solution I want to implement.\"\nThis is a clear implementation scenario. The architecture provides identity, data integration, and orchestration\nplatforms to ensure secure and scalable onboarding. These needs typically align with\nCloud & Infrastructure\n,\nCybersecurity\n, and\nEngineering Enablement\n.\nAnalytics & Compute\n​\n\"I need high-performance analytics without specialized infrastructure.\"\n\"I need high-performance analytics with custom infrastructure.\"\nThe architecture supports both managed and custom compute paths:\nFor managed needs, analytics-as-a-service platforms offer speed and scale.\nFor custom needs, utility architecture enables tailored infrastructure design.\nThese use cases align with\nData & Analytics\nand\nCloud & Infrastructure\n.\nCustom AI & Web Tools\n​\n\"I want to implement a specialized AI solution in a custom web tool.\"\nThis blends innovation with delivery. The architecture supports this through a Dev Factory model with AI and web\ndevelopment specialties, and close collaboration with UX and business design. These efforts span\nAI & Intelligent\nAgents\n,\nUser Experience & Design\n, and\nEngineering Enablement\n.\nInternal Custom Development\n​\n\"I want to build a custom solution with my dev team.\"\nThis is a full-stack build scenario. The architecture provides DevX services, platforms, and API enablement to empower\ninternal teams. These efforts typically draw from\nEngineering Enablement\n,\nCloud & Infrastructure\n, and\nObservability & Reliability\n.\nThird-Party Integration\n​\n\"A partner needs to use our identity, AE checking, and consent models.\"\nThis is a governance-heavy integration. The architecture supports it through secure APIs, workflow orchestration, and\nbusiness services. These needs intersect with\nCybersecurity\n,\nCloud & Infrastructure\n, and\nBusiness\nEnablement\n—ensuring compliance, control, and auditability.\nTech Positioning\n​\nTech positioning is the strategic process of aligning technology (including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, tools, accelerators,\ncomponents, and features) with Lilly’s goals and business needs. This ensures that every technology investment supports\nbroader objectives, such as enhancing customer experience, improving operational efficiency, and driving innovation.\nTechnology Classifications\nWe use the following\ntechnology classifications\nto describe the maturity, adoption, and strategic relevance of\ntechnologies in Tech@Lilly:\nEmerging\n– Technologies or capabilities in the early stages of exploration and experimentation. These are\ntypically undergoing\nproof-of-value\n,\npilot programs\n, or\nviability testing\nto assess potential business impact\nand feasibility.\nSpecialized\n– Solutions that are\ntailored to specific use cases\n, departments, or business units. They are\nnot\nbroadly adopted\nacross the enterprise but deliver high value in their niche applications.\nStandard\n– Technologies or capabilities that are\napproved for enterprise-wide use\n. They are\nwell-supported,\nstable, and scalable\n, with established governance, documentation, and integration patterns.\nStrategic\n– Foundational technologies or platforms that are\ncritical to the enterprise’s long-term strategy\nand operations\n. These receive\nongoing investment\n, are\ndeeply embedded\nin business processes, and are\ncentral to\ninnovation, scalability, and resilience\n.\nDeclining\n– Technologies or capabilities that are\nno longer aligned with strategic direction\n. Investment is\nbeing reduced, and a\nretirement or replacement plan\nis being developed or considered.\nRetiring\n– Solutions that are in the\nactive process of being phased out\n. Replacement technologies have been\nidentified, and\nmigration or decommissioning efforts\nare underway.\nExited\n– Technologies or capabilities that have been\nfully retired\n. They are\nno longer supported, approved, or\nin use\nwithin the enterprise environment.\nProhibited\n– Technologies or practices that are\nexplicitly blocked or restricted\ndue to\nsubstantial risk\n,\ncompliance issues\n, or a\nformal enterprise architecture decision\n. Use is not permitted under any circumstances.\nTech positioning plays a key role in optimizing our technology landscape, mitigate risks, and minimizing the cost of\nchange. It is designed for architects and technical leaders responsible for delivering products and solutions and for\naligning technology with strategic business goals.\nYou can search and browse tech positioning records on\nLillyFlow\nusing the\ntech-positioning\ntag, which are maintained by EBA as articles. To browse records for a specific capability\nor category, use the following links:\nAsk your tech positioning questions on LillyFlow\nfor\nothers to reuse the answers.

The pipeline's five\nstages go from Conceptualization to Realization to Scale.\nPre-Alpha\nAlpha\nBeta\nEarly Release\nGeneral Release\nDescription\nExploratory stage to discover and define possibilities\nInitial development stage to prove feasibility\nInitial user feedback stage to guide improvement\nPilot stage; initiate real-world use with controlled risk\nScaling stage; deploying to full intended user base\nIntent\nExplore possibilities\nDevelop demo\nHands-on preview\nLaunch system\nScale system\nAudience\nInnovator(s)\nProduct Team\nRepresentative Users\nSubset of Real Users\nAll Users\nEnvironment\nNone / Local Host / Dev\nDev\nDev / QA\nProd\nProd\nSponsorship\nNone required\nInnovation or Functional\nTech@Lilly M5\nTech@Lilly M5\nTech@Lilly M5\nExample Criteria\nProblem statement(s)\n*\nValue proposition\n*\nSolution concepts\n*\nTech feasibility assessment\nLandscape assessment\nVendor comparisons\nTech research findings / Spikes\nDemo video\n*\nInitial UI / UX designs\nRepresentative prototype(s)\nStakeholder interest / support\nInitial architecture diagram\nFunctional solution\n*\nUser feedback and confirmation\nRefined UI/UX designs\nBusiness case\nRefined architecture diagrams\nInitial product backlog\nValidation / Qualification package\n*\nProduct roadmap\nScalable architecture\nSupport & maintenance plan\nRefined business case\nBusiness value confirmation\nOngoing product lifecycle\nIncremental improvements\nRelease schedule\nMonitoring and support\nSunsetting/Rationalization plan\n*\nrequired for stage exit\nPre-Alpha\n​\nThink of this as the brainstorming stage where we're gathering sketches, wireframes, and maybe even napkin doodles. This\nisn't about clarity but about exploring and sharing potential. It’s more than just an idea.\nDefinition\nPre-alpha is the EXPLORATORY stage centered around technological and experiential possibilities. The clarity of the\ninnovation's potential is still evolving, and it includes diverse artifacts and research materials. The pre-alpha stage\nis where an idea becomes a fledgling innovation with investigative work that discovers signals of feasibility,\ndesirability, and/or viability.\nPurpose\nThe goal of this stage is to gather and communicate ideas, identify potential features, and validate core concepts. It\nsets the groundwork for the upcoming, more defined stages of development.\nExamples\n​\nRocIT Submission\nDocIT Submission\nAlpha\n​\nNow, we're onto building a rough draft or prototype. It might be a piece of software, a design blueprint, or another\nkind of tangible representation. It's not complete and its OK to have glitches or missing parts, but it's the first real\nlook at our innovation. The primary objective here? Refine our vision, iron out the kinks, and prepare for the stages\nahead.\nDefinition\nAlpha is the stage where the innovation takes its first TANGIBLE form. This may be functional software or a UX design\nthat has a fair degree of fidelity, but neither are usually ‘feature-complete’. It is usually tested internally within\nthe team involved in the early stages. It likely has bugs and incomplete features.\nPurpose\nThe primary goal of the alpha stage is to identify key features and begin to define Product scope, strategy and vision\nmore closely with a demo. This stage allows for rapid testing of the product's functionality with primary stakeholders\nand serves as a preparation for the beta stage, where a larger contingent of resources and people are be needed to\nadvance it further.\nExamples\n​\nRocIT Alpha\nDocIT Alpha\nBeta\n​\nWe're getting there! Our innovation is now usable for a small audience but might still have a few rough edges. We are\nready to provide it to a select group of users and gather their feedback. Their insights will be crucial in making sure\nour product isn't just functional, but also user- friendly and ready for a larger set of users.\nDefinition\nBeta is the stage where the innovation is ready to be used for its primary intended purpose. It is the first time the\ninnovation is provided to a select group of users in a controlled environment. A beta release provides the stability\nrequired for end users to regularly exercise functionality with minimal disruption but does not guarantee service levels\nor support agreements.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the beta stage is to gather FEEDBACK from real-world users who can identify major bugs, usability issues,\nor other potential problems that were not apparent during the alpha stage. This helps ensure the product is becoming a\nvaluable solution heading for Early Release.\nExamples\n​\nRocIT Beta\nDocIT Beta\nEarly Release\n​\nConsider this a trial run. Before we go all out, we try our innovation in a limited, real-world setting. When the stakes\nare high, it's a smart move to ensure the technology and processes are ready to scale.\nDefinition\nEarly Release is the CONFIRMATION stage where the innovation is tried in a limited real- world, supported environment.\nEarly Release limits risk when a product’s intended vision and scale includes a very large number of users/customers or\ncould negatively impact business functions if unforeseen challenges arise. This stage establishes a market test of an\ninnovation to help justify the larger investment needed to achieve full scale.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the Early Release stage is to ensure we are ready to scale. It validates the product's functionality,\nusability, and reliability in a real-world setting before it is released to a larger audience. We learn from data to\ninform decisions and ensure scalability. This stage allows for the identification and resolution of operational issues\nbefore scaling to the full intended user/customer base.\nGeneral Release\n​\nTime to roll out! Our innovation is ready to face the world. It's polished, tested, and has the stamp of approval. From\nhere on, our focus pivots from initial innovation to promotion, continuous improvements, and a roadmap of future\nfeatures and capabilities.\nDefinition\nGeneral Release marks the official introduction of the innovation to its full intended audience, whether that's a\ndepartment, the entire company, or the broader public. At this point, the innovation is fully supported and equipped to\nSCALE.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the General Release stage is to achieve the value promised by the innovation framework.\nExamples\n​\nCSA Launchpad Demo\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\ninnovation\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n💡 Tech@Lilly Innovation Pipeline\nNext\n🏎️ Fast Start\nPipeline Overview\nPre-Alpha\nExamples\nAlpha\nExamples\nBeta\nExamples\nEarly Release\nGeneral Release\nExamples\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

Instead of filming live actors, organizations can now use AI to generate videos or interactive agents that look and talk like real people. These avatars can speak in dozens of languages, clone voices and likenesses, and even emulate human mannerisms and emotions. Major enterprises are already embracing this trend: for example, over 70% of Fortune 100 companies are using AI avatar platforms like Synthesia to create training and internal communications videos at scale. In pharma, Merck KGaA uses AI avatars for multilingual product training and updates, cutting the cost and time of producing content across regions.\nSeveral categories of AI avatar solutions have matured: AI video generators (e.g. Synthesia, HeyGen, D-ID) enable anyone to turn a script into a polished video of a human presenter; meanwhile, interactive “digital people” (e.g. Soul Machines, UneeQ) allow real-time conversations with a lifelike virtual agent. These technologies rely on advanced AI models – combining deep learning for speech synthesis, computer vision, and natural language processing – to produce believable performances. Unlike traditional avatars (static cartoons or pre-recorded actors), AI avatars are dynamic and data-driven, capable of automatically lip-syncing to new dialogue, switching languages on the fly, and even responding to user input.\nFor Lilly, AI avatars present exciting opportunities in marketing, training, HR, and patient engagement. In marketing, personalized AI-driven videos can deliver consistent product messages to healthcare providers or consumers worldwide. In learning & development, training modules can be rapidly produced in multiple languages with a friendly virtual instructor, improving engagement and retention. HR and corporate communications teams can use avatars modeled from executives to broadcast updates in a relatable, cost-effective way. Early adopters report significant efficiency gains – ServiceNow cut video production time by 50% for global learning programs using AI avatars, and companies like Mondelēz produced tens of thousands of videos in a year via AI avatars.\nKey vendors in this space include Synthesia and HeyGen (leading AI video creation platforms), Soul Machines and UneeQ (interactive 3D digital humans), D-ID (AI avatar and dubbing technology), and tech giants like Microsoft and NVIDIA providing avatar generation services and tools. Their offerings already support features like cloning a person’s voice and face with consent, adding emotional expressions, 2D or full-body 3D avatars, and integration with chatbots or VR/AR environments. These capabilities will continue to expand. The technology has progressed remarkably over the past 3 years (fueled by advances in deepfake algorithms and generative AI), and recent developments point to even more realistic and controllable avatars on the horizon – with more life-like gestures, interactivity, and integration into everyday workflows.\nTo capitalize on AI avatars, innovators should consider a phased adoption strategy (from Alpha experimentation to General Release) outlined by the company’s Tech Innovation Pipeline. Early on, focus on internal, low-risk use cases like training videos or a virtual assistant for HR FAQs. As the tech and internal comfort grows, scale up to customer-facing applications (with appropriate oversight and compliance checks, given pharma’s regulatory environment). Throughout, maintain a focus on ethical guidelines – ensure avatars are used with consent, clearly identified as AI where appropriate, and content is medically accurate and approved. With right-sized governance, AI avatars can unlock cost-effective content at scale, enhance engagement (especially for video-preferring younger generations), and offer personalized support to both employees and customers. This report provides a deep dive into the technologies, top vendors, capabilities, use cases, and recommendations to help a global pharma company navigate the AI avatar landscape.\n[Notice: While the research and companies included in this report are primarily focused on AI Avatars (a talking digital person visible on a screen), it is important to note that many of the same use cases, opportunities, risks, and outlooks apply to voice-only interactions.]\nIntroduction\n​\nAI Avatars are computer-generated characters that look and sounds like real people. They leverage AI-driven animation and voice synthesis to speak and gesture in realistic ways, often indistinguishable from a video of a human. Companies adopt AI avatars to streamline video content creation and create interactive virtual agents (aka Digital People, Digital Humans) without the cost and time of using human actors, studios, and multilingual voiceover teams. The goal is to move beyond text-based communication to more engaging, human-like experiences, which deepens user engagement knowledge retention.\nEvolution (Last ~10 Years)\nThe concept of digital avatars isn’t new – video game characters and virtual assistants have existed for decades – but the last 2–5 years saw a revolution in realism thanks to AI. Early academic breakthroughs in deep learning-based face animation (often dubbed “deepfakes”) demonstrated that an AI model could make one person appear to speak words they never uttered. By the late 2010s, startups began harnessing this for business: Synthesia (founded in 2017) pioneered turning written text into videos of people speaking, and Soul Machines (founded in 2016) applied neural networks to create emotionally responsive 3D avatars. Initially, these technologies were experimental, but around 2020–2021, they hit an inflection point of quality and usability. The COVID-19 pandemic also accelerated demand for digital communication tools. By 2022, notable deployments like the World Health Organization’s “Florence” digital health worker (built by Soul Machines) showed avatars being used to disseminate health guidance interactively. In 2023–2024, generative AI and large language models (like GPT-4) further boosted avatars’ intelligence (for example, giving them conversational abilities) and big tech players entered the arena (Microsoft’s Azure AI introduced an avatar service, and NVIDIA launched its Avatar Cloud Engine). Today in 2025, AI avatars are increasingly mainstream in enterprise settings, with rapidly improving fidelity and capabilities. Major updates in the past year alone include full-body avatar animations, real-time interactive video experiences, and easier creation of custom avatars from a few photos or brief recordings.\nHow AI Avatars Work\n​\nAt a high level, an AI avatar system combines several AI components:\nText/Dialogue Generation:\nMany avatars start with a script or real-time generated text (which could come from a human-written script or an AI chatbot brain). This text is the content the avatar will speak.\nText-to-Speech (TTS):\nThe text is converted to spoken audio using advanced TTS models. Modern neural TTS can produce very natural, human-like speech, and can be trained to mimic specific voices.\nVisual Rendering (Lip Sync & Animation):\nThe core unique step: the avatar’s face (and possibly body) must be animated to speak the audio convincingly. Different platforms use different techniques:\nSome use 2D video-based models: e.g. Synthesia, HeyGen and D-ID leverage deep neural networks trained on real photos or video footage. These models take the generated speech audio (plus a base visage of the avatar) and predict corresponding lip movements and facial expressions frame-by-frame. Essentially, they “puppet” a human face to match the new audio. The underlying tech often extends from GANs or similar deep learning models that have learned how human lips move for each phoneme.\nOthers use 3D animated characters: e.g. Soul Machines, Convai, and UneeQ create a full 3D digital character (with a detailed face rig and body) and drive it with AI. Here, the system might use an animation engine (Unreal Engine, Unity, or proprietary) and AI to control the avatar’s facial muscles, eye gaze, and gestures in real time based on the speech and the context/emotion of the dialogue. These avatars can allow dynamic camera angles or be placed in AR/VR scenes because they exist as 3D models.\nSome hybrid approaches use single-image animation: e.g. D-ID can take a single photo of a person and animate it talking, by using a pretrained model that infers the 2D facial movements from audio. This is a fast way to create a talking head from one picture (though with less realism than multi-angle video training).\nIntelligence & Interactivity (optional):\nThe more exciting and advanced capabilities include emotional awareness and emotionally adaptive responses. These interactive avatar systems (aka Digital People, Digital Humans) take video and audio inputs, assess a user’s emotional context and respond like a human would. To make this possible, other AI capabilities, like sentiment analysis, need to observe, assess, and animate on the fly in order to drive the avatar’s emotional responses. For example, an avatar acting as a virtual concierge would include speech recognition to hear the user’s question, decipher tone and tenor, and adjust animation in real-time. This loop happens continuously so the avatar can converse fluidly. Leading frameworks like NVIDIA’s ACE provide pipeline components such as speech-to-text, NLP, and Audio2Face animation to support such real-time interactions.\nDespite the complexity under the hood, many modern platforms abstract this away, offering a simple studio interface or API. Users might only need to select an avatar style, input a script (or integrate their chatbot), and the system handles the rest – from generating a voice to producing a video or live avatar stream.\nAI Training Techniques\n​\nCreating lifelike avatars requires training AI on large datasets of human speech and video. For instance, Synthesia has reportedly trained large video/audio foundation models on recordings of thousands of people to improve avatar realism. These models learn the nuances of facial movement, pronunciation, and emotional expression. D-ID’s newest avatar models can learn an individual’s specific mannerisms from just a short video: their “Express Avatar” needs ~1 minute of footage to learn your head movements, while the premium model uses a few minutes of video to capture your face and even hand gestures for full-body shots. This is a significant reduction in training data compared to earlier years, thanks to more efficient AI architectures. Many systems also use pretrained models as starting points – e.g. starting from a general face-animation model and fine-tuning it to a specific person. Voice models are similarly trained on vast speech datasets and then fine-tuned to mimic a target voice via transfer learning on a smaller voice sample. The result is that with surprisingly little input data, an AI avatar platform can clone a person’s likeness (with permission). Even TIME Magazine has noted that D-ID’s avatars can replicate a person’s voice, expressions and subtle mannerisms from only a brief video input – a testament to the efficiency of modern training techniques.\nTraditional Avatars vs AI Avatars\n​\nIt’s useful to distinguish these new AI avatars from the “traditional” avatars or digital characters of the past:\nTraditional avatars (in corporate use) might include cartoon profile images, 3D game-like characters, or video footage of actors that is manually edited. They require human animators or video shoots to create or update content. For example, a classic e-learning module might have a pre-recorded video of an instructor or a manually animated cartoon character – if the script changes, you must reshoot or re-animate.\nAI avatars, by contrast, are generative. They can be instantly updated or completely created by feeding new text (for speech) or new data (to train a custom persona). There’s no need for a studio re-shoot to change what the avatar says or the language it speaks – the AI system generates the new performance on the fly. Traditional avatars also tended to be less realistic (purposefully cartoonish to avoid the uncanny valley), whereas today’s AI avatars strive for photorealism or believable human-like presence.\nAnother key differentiator is interactivity: Traditional virtual agents (like earlier chatbots with a face) often had fixed, scripted interactions. Modern AI avatars can leverage AI models to respond flexibly to users, giving a far more natural conversational experience. For instance, Soul Machines’ digital people are not pre-scripted – they react to conversational context, even recognizing user emotions via camera. They “see, hear, react, and emote like a real human,” creating a natural experience. Such fluid behavior was not possible with older rule-based avatars.\nFinally, scale and personalization: AI avatars enable automatically generating thousands of variant videos (say, one per customer with personalized greeting) – something infeasible with manually made content. This opens new use cases like personalized marketing messages delivered by a lifelike spokesperson just for you. As cost and technologies continue to improve, we are fast approaching a world where everyone will have their own interactive avatars.\nIn summary, AI avatars represent the convergence of video production, animation, and AI. They allow digital content to reach people in a humanized form, but with the speed and scalability of the digital world.\nCapabilities and Features of Modern AI Avatars\n​\nToday’s state-of-the-art AI avatar platforms boast a rich array of features. Below we outline key capabilities, along with their significance:\nLifelike Visuals (2D and 3D):\nAI avatars can appear as talking heads in a 2D video frame or as full-body 3D characters. 2D avatars look like real humans filmed with a camera, typically from the chest up. 3D avatars have a virtual body and environment, allowing more camera angles and movement. Recently, platforms have begun expanding from static torso-up shots to full-body movement. In 2024 full-body avatars emerged, capable of a range of motions and gestures, enabling them to use hand movements and body language in videos. This adds realism and engagement, as body language is a huge part of human communication.\nVoice Cloning and Multilingual Speech:\nAI avatars can be given almost any voice. Many platforms provide a library of synthetic voices in numerous languages. Increasingly, they also offer custom voice cloning, where you can create a unique voice font (e.g. to use your own voice for your avatar). Synthesia and HeyGen both advertise voice cloning features, and Microsoft’s Azure AI specifically allows training a custom neural voice. This means an avatar could speak with the tone of a specific executive or brand ambassador (with consent). The multilingual abilities are also striking – most leading avatars support dozens of languages. Synthesia supports 140+ languages for text-to-speech, and D-ID’s video translate tool can convert videos into over 120 languages with accurate cloned voices and lip-sync. For a global company, this feature is invaluable: one master video can be automatically localized for regional audiences, maintaining the same visual but speaking the local language. This vastly reduces the need for subtitles or separate video shoots per language.\nRealistic Facial Expressions and Emotions:\nEarlier AI avatars sometimes appeared emotionless or “wooden.” Now, there’s a big emphasis on making them expressive and emotionally engaging. Providers use two approaches: (1) have the avatar detect sentiment in the script or conversation and adjust expression/tone accordingly, and (2) allow users to specify an emotion or speaking style. Synthesia’s new Expressive model (EXPRESS-1) enables avatars to understand context and sentiment in text and change their tone and facial expression appropriately. HeyGen likewise launched “Avatar 3.0” with emotion-aware animation, where the avatar’s movements reflect the emotional cues in the script (for example, smiling, frowning, or gesturing more dramatically for emphasis). This makes the avatars more engaging and human-like, rather than speaking in a flat monotone. It’s particularly useful in training or marketing content to convey enthusiasm, empathy, or seriousness as needed.\nPersonalized Avatar Creation (Custom Avatars):\nWhile there are many stock avatars available (Synthesia alone offers 230+ diverse avatar personas), organizations often want their own people represented or a custom character aligning with their brand. Modern platforms enable this in a few ways:\nSelf-Service Avatar Creation:\nSome solutions now let a user create a custom avatar by simply providing a few images or a short video of a person. Synthesia’s experimental “Selfie Avatars” feature allows creating a custom avatar from just a few images of yourself. D-ID’s “Photo Avatar” similarly can animate an uploaded photo. HeyGen has taken it further, offering a pipeline to create “Community Avatars” and even generate avatar faces from text prompts (AI-generated faces). This means you can get a unique virtual presenter without hiring an actor – either based on a real person’s likeness or an AI-designed face.\nCustom Avatar with Your Own Video:\nFor higher fidelity, enterprise-oriented platforms allow training the avatar on a professionally recorded video of a person speaking. Microsoft’s Azure Avatar service, for instance, supports custom avatars by uploading your own video recordings, which it uses to train a neural avatar that closely resembles that person (especially if combined with a custom voice). D-ID’s Premium+ avatars require a few minutes of footage of the person but in return can even emulate their torso and hand movements for more dynamic shots.\nThe result of these innovations is that a company can clone an executive, instructor, or actor as an avatar (with their permission). That avatar can then deliver any message you need, saving that person from having to be on camera each time. It’s already used in practice – many Synthesia customers have their own CEO or spokesperson avatar. This raises interesting questions (addressed later) about disclosure and authenticity, but technologically it’s a game-changer for scalable content creation.\nInteractive and Conversational Abilities:\nOne of the most exciting capabilities turns avatars from one-way, pre-recorded video presenters into two-way, interactive agents. Interactive avatars can listen to users (via text or voice input) and respond in real time with speech and appropriate facial reactions. Soul Machines specializes in this – their avatars are essentially AI assistants with a face, capable of free-form conversation. They even possess memory and computer vision: a Soul Machines avatar can recognize objects or people it sees through a camera and remember past interactions to personalize the dialogue. This enables use cases like virtual coaches or advisors. For example, Soul Machines reports that their AI wellness coach can watch a user practice a task (like a job interview answer) and give real-time feedback, noticing if the user appears nervous or if their attire is appropriate. On the more business side, HeyGen introduced Interactive Avatar characters that can serve as a “Zoom assistant” or product expert – effectively the avatar is tied to a chatbot/LLM that answers questions, while the avatar provides the face and voice for the AI’s answers. D-ID also has a chat API where you can hook an avatar up to systems like ChatGPT to create a conversational agent; their avatars were recognized by TIME as an innovative way to make chatbot interactions feel more human. This capability opens doors for virtual customer service reps, virtual patient guides, or interactive training simulations (more on use cases later).\nPhysics and Environment Integration:\nIn more advanced or 3D scenarios, avatars can be placed in virtual or real environments and respond to those contexts. For instance, in VR/AR, an avatar might need to match lighting and physics of the world so it appears believable next to real objects. Some platforms allow adjusting lighting on the avatar or use graphics engines to ensure the avatar casts shadows, etc., if composited into real scenes. While this is a niche feature mostly for AR/VR or high-end video production, it’s worth noting. NVIDIA’s toolkit, for example, provides ways to embed avatars in game engines so they have spatial awareness – e.g. an NPC (non-player character) avatar can navigate around and pick up virtual objects. In enterprise settings, this could translate to AR training where a digital human guides a technician through a task, appearing anchored in the physical space.\nCamera Movement and Shot Control:\nInitially, most AI avatar videos were simple “locked-off” shots (avatar centered, direct-to-camera). Now, tools are adding more cinematographic control. Users can choose camera zoom levels, angles, or even have the avatar change position between cuts. HeyGen’s platform, for example, offers an “AI Studio” editor with the ability to add motion – so you could start with a close-up and then switch to a wider shot with the avatar in a different background, all within one generated video. They tout features like the ability to change backgrounds, outfits, stances, and camera angles with the same avatar footage. This is achieved by their “Unlimited Looks” technology – essentially re-synthesizing the avatar with different attire or environment without needing new video shoots. Such control allows more dynamic, multi-scene videos (akin to a normal video edit) entirely through AI synthesis.\nStoryboarding and Workflow Tools:\nTo make avatar video creation accessible, many platforms include template libraries and storyboard tools. Users can script a sequence of scenes – e.g. first scene: avatar A delivers intro, second scene: switch to a screen-share or slides, third scene: avatar B concludes. Tools like Synthesia and HeyGen provide pre-built templates for common video types (e.g. corporate training, marketing pitch) and allow inserting other stock media (images, charts, screen recordings) alongside the avatar’s footage. This workflow integration is crucial for enterprise use, letting a non-video-specialist create complete, polished videos. For example, Synthesia’s platform now includes an AI screen recorder (record your screen with voice, and it will generate an avatar presenting it) and one-click translation/localization of an entire video. D-ID recently introduced a Scenes feature to build video sequences with multiple avatars, backgrounds and dynamic text overlays for storytelling. These workflow features mean AI avatars are not a standalone novelty, but part of a broader video production solution that fits into corporate content pipelines (often with collaboration, review, and versioning support).\nContent Moderation and Safety Features:\nGiven the potential misuse of hyper-realistic avatars (e.g. deepfake concerns), responsible vendors have built-in controls and moderation guardrails. Content moderation includes preventing the generation of disallowed content (hate speech, sexual or violent content, etc.) and ensuring avatars of real people are only made with consent. Synthesia, for instance, has stringent policies – it does not allow public figures to be cloned and politically oriented content is restricted to enterprise accounts with disclosure. They even participated in a public red-team test of their moderation, showing resilience against generating deepfake abuse. Many platforms tag or watermark the AI videos in metadata as synthetic. Another aspect is ethical use of actors’ likeness – Synthesia has a talent program to compensate the real actors who have provided their faces for stock avatars, including a revenue share and early insight into how their avatar is used. These measures, while not “features” in the traditional sense, are important capabilities of a mature enterprise-ready avatar platform: to ensure safe, consensual and transparent use of the technology.\nCost Efficiency and Scale:\nThough not a feature per se, it’s a key selling point – AI avatars dramatically reduce costs of video production. Once a custom avatar is made, producing a new video is essentially generating data (no studios, cameras, travel, or on-camera talent needed). The cost is typically a software subscription or per-video fee. Many companies report saving significantly. For instance, what used to require a film crew and weeks of work can now be done by a single employee in a day with an AI platform. The marginal cost of additional videos is low, enabling large-scale video content strategies (such as personalized videos for thousands of recipients). Additionally, some vendors highlight energy efficiency – Synthesia published that AI video generation can have a smaller carbon footprint than traditional video production, aligning with sustainability goals.\nIntegration and API Access:\nFinally, modern avatar services offer APIs and integrations so that they can plug into other systems. For example, Synthesia and D-ID provide API endpoints where another software can programmatically generate videos. This could allow, say, a learning management system to automatically generate an avatar video for each new policy update, or a CRM to send a personalized avatar video to a customer when they sign up. For example, D-ID’s enterprise suite integrates with tools like Canva and PowerPoint for easy content import, and can connect with CRMs/marketing automation to insert avatar videos into campaigns. Microsoft’s Azure avatar service integrates naturally with Azure’s bot framework and other cognitive services (one can imagine an Azure bot with an avatar front-end in Teams). These integrations indicate the technology is maturing into an ecosystem component rather than a standalone novelty.\nIn summary, AI avatars today can clone voices and faces, express emotion, deliver content in 100+ languages, interact with users, and be flexibly customized – all while offering enterprise-grade workflow integration and moderation. This wide feature set underpins their broad applicability across business functions.\nTop Vendors and Key Players\n​\nThe AI avatar landscape features a mix of specialized startups and large technology companies. Below we provide a balanced overview of major players, their offerings, and recent developments, with a focus on those relevant to Lilly use. In addition to these overviews and list of features, many additional factors must be considered prior to beginning a project with any AI Avatar vendor.\nContact your Enterprise Business Architect for the latest in vendor positioning and availability for Lilly use.\nSynthesia\nWidely regarded as a market leader in AI avatar videos, Synthesia is a U.K.-based company that provides a platform to create videos with photorealistic avatars from text. It offers a web studio with many stock avatars (diverse ethnicities, ages, professional looks) and the ability to create custom avatars. Synthesia has a strong enterprise focus – boasting over 60,000 customers by 2023 and serving 70% of Fortune 100 firms. Use cases center on corporate training, how-to videos, and internal communications. What sets Synthesia apart is its creator platform with notable polish and reliability: it produces high-quality lip-sync, supports 130+ languages, and provides features like one-click video translation and an AI script assistant. Recent innovations from Synthesia include:\nSynthesia 2.0 Platform: Launched in mid-2024, bringing full-body avatars with gestures and an interactive video player. The interactive video feature will let viewers click on elements in the video (e.g. a calendar pop-up to book a meeting or a quiz question). This blurs the line between passive video and e-learning app, all within an avatar-led video.\nExpressive Avatars: A new “Express” model that gives avatars context awareness to modulate tone. An avatar can sound upbeat or concerned depending on the content of the script, without the user manually specifying it – making videos feel less robotic.\nPersonal Avatars and Selfie Avatars: Synthesia opened up easier custom avatar creation. Instead of requiring a studio filming session, users can record themselves with a normal webcam (with a natural background) to create a personal avatar. This lowers the barrier for organizations to let many employees create their own avatars for internal use. The avatars’ lip sync and voice can then be auto-generated, including translation of the user’s own voice into other languages.\nScale and Governance: Synthesia has focused on responsible AI – implementing rigorous content moderation (e.g., no public figure avatars, no political disinformation usage) and even achieving an ISO 42001 certification for AI trust and security (a first in the industry). They also partner with major tech (Adobe invested in them, and they use NVIDIA GPUs on Google Cloud for training). With a $180M Series D funding in 2023, Synthesia is well-capitalized to drive innovation.\nFor Lilly, Synthesia’s extensive enterprise adoption and emphasis on compliance are reassuring – it’s a stable choice for large-scale deployment of avatar tech for training or comms.\nHeyGen\nHeyGen (formerly Movio) is another prominent AI video platform, often seen as a competitor to Synthesia with a blend of similar and unique features. It provides a diverse set of 500+ avatars (including not just photoreal actors but also some stylized ones) and supports 70+ languages. HeyGen’s recent Fall 2024 release introduced cutting-edge features:\nGenerative Avatars from Text: Users can create avatar “looks” from prompts – essentially generating a new digital actor via AI. For example, one could type “an older doctor with kind eyes” and get a unique avatar face to use. This is still experimental but showcases the ability to tailor avatar appearance to niche audiences or brand image without hiring an actor.\nEmotion-Aware and Motion Improvements: HeyGen’s “Avatar 3.0” avatars respond to emotion cues in the script, adding expressive depth and natural motions to deliver the message convincingly. They also rolled out 50+ new filmed actors with 400+ outfit and background combinations to cover more scenarios (e.g., an avatar at a hospital vs. in an office). The “Unlimited Looks” feature allows a custom avatar to be shown in different clothing and settings by uploading additional reference footage, which is valuable for continuity (your avatar can change attire like a real person would on different days).\nInteractive AI Agents: Notably, HeyGen has launched an Interactive Avatar feature – these avatars can literally hold conversations, acting as support agents or even sitting in on video calls on your behalf. They listen to user queries and respond, presumably by integrating with an AI like GPT-4 for the brain. This positions HeyGen not just for video creation but also for real-time customer service or employee assistant use cases.\nVideo Translation and other tools: Like competitors, HeyGen offers video dubbing (translate an existing video into other languages with the same speaker’s avatar/voice) and a Chrome extension that turns a voice recording into an avatar video automatically.\nHeyGen has been aggressive in feature development (shipping updates “at lightning speed”), making it an attractive, often slightly more consumer-friendly option. It also tends to market flexible pricing and a free tier, which helped it gain popularity among individual creators and small businesses.\nFor a Lilly, HeyGen could be useful for quick-turnaround projects or creative marketing experiments, especially if the goal is to prototype capabilities like interactive rep avatars or generate a variety of spokesperson styles via prompt.\nD-ID\nIsraeli startup, D-ID started with “talking photo” technology and has grown into a platform for both asynchronous video creation and real-time conversational avatars. D-ID is known for its ease of turning a single image into a video of a person speaking, which gained fame through products like MyHeritage’s “Deep Nostalgia” (animating old photos). Key features of D-ID:\nCreative Reality Studio: D-ID’s web studio allows users to create videos by uploading an image (or choosing a stock avatar) and entering text. It has a library of voices and supports numerous languages. A big draw is the ability to animate any face – even historical figures or personal photos (with appropriate rights) – into a speaking avatar.\nHigh-Quality Avatar Modes: In late 2024, D-ID launched new Express and Premium+ avatar tiers. Express avatars train quickly (≈1 minute of video input needed) and capture basic head movement, suited for fast setup. Premium+ avatars require a bit more training footage (a few minutes) but produce much more lifelike results, including upper body and hand gestures. Premium+ avatars are also capable of real-time interactions, which D-ID suggests for use cases like live webinars or live language translation of a speaker. This essentially means a person’s digital double could speak live in many languages or engage an audience in Q&A.\nEnterprise Marketing Suite: D-ID is positioning strongly for marketing use cases. They report that personalized video campaigns created with their avatars significantly boost engagement (30% higher click-through, 35% higher conversion in their early data). To support this, they introduced an array of tools – interactive embedded video (avatar asks the viewer questions or responds to choices), integration with Canva/PPT for content design, and API hooks into CRM and marketing automation. This indicates D-ID’s focus on letting brands incorporate avatars into customer outreach (from outbound personalized ads to inbound customer service via “AI agents”).\nPartnerships and Recognition: D-ID partnered with Microsoft in 2025 to bring “agentic AI avatars” into Microsoft’s ecosystem. One application is expected integration with Microsoft Teams or Azure, meaning you might have D-ID powered avatars for live meetings or virtual assistants in enterprise workflows. Additionally, D-ID’s tech was named one of TIME’s best inventions of 2024, underscoring its cutting-edge nature. TIME highlighted how D-ID’s conversational avatars (with LLM brains) create a more engaging, face-to-face interface for AI.\nUse in Healthcare/Pharma: D-ID has already seen use in healthcare training. A noteworthy example is the Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine, which used D-ID avatars as virtual patients to simulate clinical scenarios for students. These “AI patients” converse with students, allowing them to practice history-taking and communication in a realistic but controlled environment. This suggests a direct application to pharma in medical education and sales training (e.g., reps practicing detailing a drug with a lifelike doctor avatar as the audience, or trainees interviewing a virtual patient about side effects).\nOverall, D-ID’s strength is its versatility (from simple photo animation to enterprise-grade interactive avatars) and its focus on making avatar tech accessible (they even have a mobile app). It might appeal to marketing teams for quick content and to innovation teams for building interactive AI agent prototypes. Ensuring proper licensing and consent for any real faces used would be a consideration, which D-ID addresses through its ethics policy and partnerships (for example, they partner with stock image libraries and have usage guidelines).\nSoul Machines\nIn contrast to the above “video generator” companies, Soul Machines is all about autonomous animated digital people. A New Zealand-based company co-founded by Oscar-winning animator Mark Sagar, Soul Machines builds fully 3D avatars that are driven by AI in real time, aiming for unprecedented realism and empathy in interactions. Key highlights:\nDigital DNA and “Biological” AI: Soul Machines created a platform that combines neural networks with models of human biology (they call it “Experiential AI”). This means their avatars don’t just lip-sync to text; they have a sort of digital nervous system that simulates things like micro-expressions, eye movements, and emotional responses. They often refer to their avatars having a “Digital Brain” that can process inputs (vision, audio) and maintain an evolving emotional state.\nInteractivity and Sensing: A hallmark is that Soul Machines avatars can see through the user’s webcam, hear through the microphone, and respond with appropriate facial reactions. For example, if the user smiles or frowns, the avatar may adapt its demeanor. They can also detect objects (as of their 2024 update) – the avatar could recognize a pill bottle the user holds up, for instance, and incorporate that into the conversation. Memory features allow them to recall user details across sessions.\nUse Cases and Industries: Soul Machines targets high-value interactions like coaching, customer experience, healthcare, etc. The WHO’s Florence 2.0 digital health worker is a flagship example – Florence (an avatar of a female health advisor) can talk about COVID-19, mental health, nutrition, and more, and is being developed to speak multiple languages to serve global populations. Florence is envisioned to help fill gaps in healthcare education where human resources are scarce. In the corporate realm, Soul Machines has created digital twins of celebrities (e.g., a digital Will.i.am as a customer engagement avatar) and works with companies like HSBC, Nestle, and Daimler for customer service pilots.\nFor Lilly, one could imagine Soul Machines avatars as digital health coaches (guiding patients through medication management with empathy), or as virtual sales reps that can train or even interact with doctors in a human-like way.\nRecent Advancements: As cited earlier, Soul Machines recently added object recognition and long-term memory to their avatars, making interactions more context-aware. They also launched a self-service “Soul Studio” where clients can design and deploy their own digital people relatively quickly – lowering the barrier from a fully custom build (which used to involve Soul Machines’ in-house team modeling an avatar) to a more configurable SaaS approach. Additionally, partnerships like the one with ServiceNow integrate their avatars into existing enterprise workflow systems (imagine an avatar that can not only talk to you but also create a support ticket or pull up your account info via backend integration).\nSoul Machines’ avatars are perhaps the most technologically sophisticated in simulating human interaction. However, they are also resource-intensive (typically requiring GPU cloud rendering) and currently less common than video-based avatars for things like simple training videos. They shine in live, interactive scenarios that benefit from emotional engagement.\nRecent exits by all founding members and new executive team has shifted Soul Machine’s product strategy, focusing attention on subscription-based life coach avatars for the consumer market.\nFor Lilly, using Soul Machines might be part of a high-touch digital initiative – for example, a virtual patient companion for a chronic disease program that checks in on patients, or an internal coaching avatar for employee wellness. The ROI would need to justify the complexity (as these are not as turnkey as, say, Synthesia videos), but the differentiation in user experience is significant. A patient might respond more to a compassionate digital human that listens and remembers, than to a static chatbot or a series of videos.\nUneeQ\nAnother player in interactive digital humans, UneeQ (originating from New Zealand as well) offers a platform to create “digital companions” for customer service, sales, and training. UneeQ’s avatars are 3D animated characters similar to Soul Machines’, though UneeQ emphasizes a modular approach, integrating best-of-breed AI services for voice, conversation, etc. They have an authoring platform where clients can choose or design an avatar’s look, plug in an NLP brain (like IBM Watson or Microsoft Bot Framework), and deploy the avatar on websites, kiosks, or AR/VR devices.\nUneeQ was behind some well-known demos, like the “Digital Einstein” avatar that one could chat with to learn facts or just experience conversing with a historical figure. In healthcare, UneeQ created “Sophie,” a COVID-19 advice avatar in early 2020 that provided information to the public about the pandemic. They have case studies such as a digital human for a diabetes charity to answer questions, and a virtual shopping assistant for a retail brand.\nUneeQ highlights its ability to deploy avatars across channels – from web to even holographic displays for events. They also tout integrations: for instance, a digital human concierge that ties into hotel databases, or a training coach that connects to LMS content. Their Synapse (or Synanim) engine handles the coordination of speech, gestures, expressions, and remembering conversation context.\nFor enterprise usage, UneeQ has packaged solutions like a “Sales Trainer” digital human for employee training role-plays, and customer-facing digital greeters. They might not have the massive customer count of Synthesia, but UneeQ is a strong option for bespoke interactive avatar projects. In a pharma setting, UneeQ could be leveraged to create, say, a virtual medical representative to handle common doctor questions on demand, or a digital human resources assistant to help employees navigate benefits (in a more engaging way than reading FAQs). The choice between Soul Machines and UneeQ often comes down to the style and complexity of interaction desired, business relationships, and potentially cost – UneeQ markets a more scalable cloud platform which might be more accessible for mid-tier use.\nMicrosoft (Azure AI Services)\nMicrosoft entered the avatar arena by leveraging its strengths in speech and cloud integration. Azure’s Text-to-Speech Avatar service became publicly available in late 2023. This service allows Azure customers to generate photorealistic talking head videos from text, using either Microsoft’s pre-made avatars or a custom one:\nPrebuilt avatars are provided by Microsoft out-of-box, each with a certain look, and they can speak any text in supported languages using Azure’s neural voices.\nCustom avatars enable an organization to upload video of a person (and optionally create a custom voice) to train an avatar that looks and sounds like that person. Microsoft emphasizes that this is a Limited Access feature – you must apply and describe your use case, to ensure it’s used ethically. They have guardrails in place as part of their Responsible AI commitment (e.g., presumably ensuring the person has consented if you clone them).\nMicrosoft’s entry is significant because of integration: these avatars can be tied into Azure’s AI ecosystem. For example, Lilly could use Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) to generate dynamic dialogue, Azure Speech to handle input/output, and the Avatar to present it. A cited scenario is a “virtual HR assistant” where an avatar answers employees’ HR questions, or a “CEO’s digital twin presenting at a conference” in multiple languages. Being able to swap a live appearance with a generated one that still feels personal is an attractive use case (particularly in a world of virtual meetings).\nMicrosoft has also hinted at using avatars in Teams (their enterprise meeting app). Although currently Teams offers cartoon-like 3D avatars, the partnership with D-ID suggests they might bring more realistic avatars for certain meeting or training scenarios. Also, Azure’s avatar is available via API, meaning developers can embed it in custom apps (e.g., a telehealth portal could show a doctor avatar explaining how to take a medication).\nFor Lilly, already invested in Azure platform, the Microsoft AI Avatar service could be appealing. It would allow leveraging existing Azure security, scalability, and perhaps even pricing benefits under enterprise agreements. It’s relatively new and part of a recent startup acquisition, so it lacks many features (e.g., the studio interface is likely more utilitarian than any other). But Microsoft’s investment in both real-time bots and content generation with avatars is a strong sign this tech is considered important in the future of communication. One could imagine a near future where every corporate employee has a little AI avatar helper (instead of just a chat icon), powered by these services.\nNVIDIA\nNvidia does not directly offer an end-user avatar app but provides the tools to build avatars, especially for gaming, simulation, and high-end interactive use. Their Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) is a toolkit of AI models and microservices for developers to create interactive avatars. This includes:\nAudio2Face – which generates facial animation from audio input.\nRiva – for speech-to-text and text-to-speech, supporting multiple languages.\nNeMo / LLM services – for conversational AI (NVIDIA offers customizable large language models that can run locally or in cloud).\nBy combining these, a developer can give an avatar the ability to listen, think (via an LLM), and speak with realistic lip-sync. NVIDIA demonstrated this at CES 2024 showing AI-powered NPCs in video games that have unscripted dialogues and react to player behavior. Game studios like Ubisoft and companies like Convai and Inworld (which create AI NPCs) are using ACE. Even enterprise avatar companies such as UneeQ are also listed as partners leveraging NVIDIA’s tech.\nWhy this matters to Lilly\n: If we want to build something very custom – say a proprietary virtual trainer with a unique look integrated deeply into a simulation or our own creator platform – we may want to use NVIDIA’s stack under the hood. NVIDIA also pushes the envelope in innovation: for example, their research in eye contact simulation, voice modulation, and instant animation could filter into commercial products soon. They also ensure these capabilities run efficiently on GPUs, which is crucial for real-time avatars. Additionally, NVIDIA’s tech can be used on-device (for privacy) or via cloud.\nAs a basic building block for AI Avatar animation, NVIDIA could likely act as a major catalyst that continues to drive the entire AI Avatar market forward.\nFor Lilly, a ready-made solution from the above vendors will be sufficient. But it’s worth noting that NVIDIA’s ACE is enabling a new wave of AI Avatar startups offering immersive experiences (especially in AR/VR). If, for instance, Lilly innovators envision an advanced VR training lab where trainees talk to virtual patients, the developers building that could use ACE components to achieve the realism and interactivity required.\nConvai\nConvai is a company that focuses on creating AI-driven avatars, also known as digital humans, that can simulate human-like behavior, speech, and expressions in real-time. These avatars leverage advances in AI to move beyond pre-defined animations, enabling more natural and personalized interactions. Convai offers a Unity SDK to add conversational AI characters into websites and AR applications, making it relevant for training simulations. This technology allows for the creation of virtual patients or doctors in a simulation, like the SIU case but embedded in a 3D training environment.\nConvai's avatars are dynamic and can hold conversations, answer questions, and even show context-appropriate emotions. They can be used in various applications, including marketing, learning and development, HR, training, and corporate communications. The key differences between traditional and AI avatars include automation of behavior, intelligence and interactivity, personalization, multilingual and scalable content, and real-time responsiveness.\nInterestingly for Lilly\n, Convai offers large customers the opportunity to self-host, which often reduces/eliminates many confidentiality and security risks typically found with third-party integrations.\nOthers and Emerging Players\nA myriad startups are coming up in specific domains: e.g., some focus on avatars for education (a virtual tutor that looks like a friendly teacher), some on virtual influencers for social media, and so on. The ecosystem is vibrant, but the ones outlined above are the key players likely to be relevant to a large global company’s needs today.\nMeta (Facebook) is researching “Codec Avatars” (ultra-realistic telepresence avatars) and deploying simpler avatars in Horizon Workrooms (though those are cartoonish). Apple is using a face-scanning approach for its Vision Pro “Persona” avatar (not AI-generated, but potentially Apple could incorporate AI for expressions or automated behaviors in future). Alibaba and other Chinese firms have their own avatar initiatives (for virtual influencers on e-commerce, etc.), but those are region-specific.\nIn summary, the field has both platform players (Synthesia, HeyGen, D-ID – competing to be the go-to video avatar tool) and interactive avatar specialists (Soul Machines, UneeQ – offering rich real-time digital humans). Additionally, big tech (Microsoft, Nvidia) provides core infrastructure that may either underpin those platforms or be used directly for custom solutions. When evaluating vendors, innovators should consider factors like: quality of lip-sync and visuals, language/voice support, ease of use, data privacy (where is the avatar generation happening – on vendor cloud or Lilly-hosted), integration capabilities, and of course cost and licensing.\nSecondary “Wrapper” Vendors: Pattern & Pitfalls\n​\nEvery time a major technology platform reaches the Peak of Inflated Expectations, a long tail of fast-moving service shops and startups springs up to “wrap” the underlying APIs with a lighter UX or vertical pitch. Gartner flagged this behavior in the early cloud era, noting that cloud resellers would soon “tip over the peak and experience disillusionment” once enterprises realized they could contract AWS or Azure directly.\nThis same dynamic is repeating with AI Avatars, indicated by the following points:\nHigh failure‐to-scale rate. A Forbes analysis of 230 gen-AI pilots found ≈ 90 % never progress beyond proof-of-concept; IDC places the attrition rate at 88 % in production settings\nCommodity risk. TechCrunch notes that many “GPT-for-X” firms are thin wrappers “creating little more than UI glue around someone else’s model,” leaving them exposed the instant the platform owner launches a native feature\nPlatform consolidation. Analyst reporting shows large model providers “aggressively launching native features that steam-roll wrapper startups”\nDue-Diligence Checklist for Assessing Avatar Vendors\nDisclosure of underlying stack: Demand the contract list which foundation model, TTS engine, and rendering pipeline generates the avatar.\nDirect-license availability: Verify you cannot obtain the same capability straight from Synthesia, Hey Gen, D-ID, Microsoft Azure, or NVIDIA at enterprise terms.\nScalability proof: Request production metrics (QPS, concurrent sessions, regional fail-over) tied to their own infrastructure, not screenshots of the core platform’s SLA dashboard.\nSecurity boundary review: Map OAuth scopes, data residency, and retention policies; extra hops often double the blast radius of a breach.\nExit & portability clause: Insert a 30-day transition provision and insist that all model artifacts, custom avatar assets, and scripts be exportable in a standard format.\nStrategic Guidance for Business Stakeholders\nPrioritize core-platform partnerships for production work (key players listed in this report).\nLeverage boutique “wrapper” vendors only for examples and time-boxed engagements when they provide domain expertise your teams lack, then seek to fill the team gaps. Ensure agreements include a pre-agreed sunset or hand-off plan.\nRetain the vertical value layer internally. Internal functions (Medical Affairs, L&D, HR, etc.) should own scriptwriting, compliance, and standards; third parties should supply technology plumbing, not the industry narrative.\nMaintain a consolidated vendor scorecard to monitor financial health, release cadence, and security posture; thin-wrapper firms often plateau once feature overlap grows with the underlying platform.\nOverall, minimize exploration into intermediaries. In the generative AI “gold-rush”, longevity and compliance will belong to vendors with control over the core AI models and infrastructure. Think of these pop-up offerings as riders in someone else’s car - useful for conversations and insights, hazardous for mission-critical scale.\nApplications in Pharma (and Other Industries)\n​\nAI avatars have cross-industry applicability wherever communication, instruction, or personal interaction is involved. Below we explore use cases and examples, focusing on pharmaceuticals and healthcare, but also drawing from other industries to illustrate possibilities and spur thought.\nMarketing and Sales Communication\nProduct Marketing Videos: Pharma companies can use AI avatars to create explainer videos for new drug launches, mechanism-of-action animations with an avatar narrator, or patient education videos about a disease. Traditionally, creating multilingual promotional videos or KOL (key opinion leader) testimonial videos is expensive. With avatars, one could, for example, generate a video of a “virtual doctor” explaining the benefits of a treatment in 10 different languages, all without a single physical shoot. Merck KGaA’s team already replaced many live-recorded product update videos with Synthesia avatars to rapidly localize content for internal sales teams. Similarly, marketing departments can A/B test different avatar personas (perhaps one avatar resonates better with cardiologists vs another with oncologists) by simply switching the digital actor – something impractical with real actors.\nPersonalized Outreach: Imagine sending a personalized video message to HCPs where an avatar addresses the doctor by name and provides tailored info (e.g., “Dr. Smith, here’s data relevant to your practice from our new clinical trial”). Companies like Vidyard or BombBomb have shown that personalized video in sales outreach increases engagement; AI avatars can deliver this personalization at scale without individual reps recording hundreds of videos.\nVirtual Sales Reps (Interactive): In some cases, an avatar could act as a stand-in for a human sales rep, especially for “no-see” accounts or during odd hours. For instance, a doctor could click a button to “Chat with an expert now” and a friendly avatar appears (perhaps a digital twin of their medical science liaison), ready to answer questions via an AI backend honed on a particular drug product. This avatar could show slides or data on prompt and talk through them. While it won’t replace important face-to-face rep visits, it can provide on-demand support and product information. GSK reportedly piloted a virtual sales rep avatar for some product inquiries (hypothetical example to illustrate, as many companies are considering hybrid models). This is analogous to how some banks use digital avatar tellers in kiosks – the pharma version would need to be closely governed (ensuring accurate, approved responses only).\nDigital Brand Ambassadors: Outside of HCPs, avatars could appear in consumer-facing campaigns. For example, Lilly could create a virtual influencer avatar (perhaps a character representing a patient advocate) to raise awareness on social media about a condition or wellness tips, answering questions in comments using an AI brain. This has been tried in other industries – e.g., cosmetic brands have virtual influencer avatars – and though experimental, it can humanize the brand in a controlled way (since the company scripts or approves the avatar’s messaging).\nLearning & Development (L&D) and Training\nEmployee Training Videos: Compliance training, safety protocols, new SOP rollouts – all staples in pharma – require frequent training refreshers across global teams. AI avatars excel here by producing engaging training videos quickly and in many languages. Instead of dense documents or slides, an avatar can walk employees through a new code-of-conduct policy with visual aids. Internal communications were among the first widespread uses of Synthesia at companies like SAP. The University College London even studied AI-generated video learning and found benefits for adult learners, indicating that well-designed avatar videos can be as effective as live video in learning contexts.\nSales Training and Role-Play: Pharmaceutical sales reps undergo extensive training for product knowledge and handling doctor interactions. Avatars can play the role of a “virtual doctor” for reps to practice on. For instance, UneeQ offers a sales trainer avatar that can simulate customer personalities and questions. A rep could speak (or type) to the avatar, and the AI doctor might interject with tough questions or objections in a realistic manner, helping the rep practice responses in a safe environment. Given the consistency of AI, every rep can be measured on the same scenarios, and the avatar can provide feedback or even scoring (especially if hooked to speech analytics that assess confidence or accuracy). This kind of training augmentation can complement human role-play sessions, and it’s available 24/7 for practice.\nClinical Training & Medical Education: AI avatars can be used in e-learning modules for clinicians. More interestingly, as seen with the SIU School of Medicine’s AI patient simulations, avatars can take on the role of patients with certain conditions for med students or HCPs to practice diagnostic interviewing. For example, an avatar could present as a patient with migraine – describing symptoms, possibly even showing pain via facial expression – and the learner has to ask the right questions. The avatar (driven by an LLM with a preset case profile) can answer in a natural, non-scripted way, making the scenario realistic. This can help HCPs build communication skills and empathy. Lilly could support such training as part of educational grants or internal training for medical staff.\nOnboarding and HR Training: Welcoming new employees to Lilly can include lots of orientation videos. An avatar could serve as an onboarding buddy, introducing the company’s values, giving office virtual tours, etc., in a personalized way. And when policies update (like IT security protocols), an avatar can quickly be deployed in an explainer video that might be more watched than a long memo. Some companies have even used AI avatars to answer common HR questions for employees, freeing up HR staff from repetitive queries. Microsoft’s scenario of a “virtual HR assistant” avatar is relevant here. This can be particularly useful in a large company where employees might have questions about benefits, travel policy, etc., and prefer a quick, spoken answer over digging through an intranet site.\nHuman Resources and Corporate Communications\nLeadership Messages: It’s a challenge for top executives to communicate frequently with a global workforce in their native languages. AI avatars allow creation of leadership video messages with minimal time from the executive. For instance, our CEO could type out or dictate a message about the company strategy, and have their own avatar deliver it in multiple languages to all employees. This ensures consistency of message and a personal touch (seeing Dave Ricks “speak”) without scheduling video shoots across time zones. Lilly must balance authenticity (some employees may prefer the real Dave Ricks despite language barriers) with efficiency, but this tool can dramatically increase the reach of leadership comms. We have already examples of townhalls that leverage a mix of real person/avatar presentations. Notably, Microsoft’s avatar service explicitly lists “CEO digital twin for a conference” as a use case.\nRecruitment: In recruitment marketing, avatars can be the face of the company – e.g., a friendly avatar on the careers page that tells prospective candidates about company culture and answers FAQs (“What is it like to work in R&D at Lilly?”). This can be interactive or simply a video. It provides a novel, engaging way to consume info compared to text. Additionally, for initial candidate screening, some firms have experimented with avatar interviewers that pose questions and record answers (to avoid human interviewer bias in facial reactions). Though the ethics of AI in interviews are debated, using a consistent avatar interviewer could standardize the process for all candidates. At minimum, avatars might guide candidates through an application process or pre-interview prep (like a virtual recruiter giving tips).\nInternal Communications: Avatars might also serve roles in employee resource groups or internal campaigns. For instance, a wellness campaign could feature an avatar “coach” that shares daily health tips or mindfulness exercises via short videos to employees. Because avatars can reflect diversity (you can choose avatars of different genders, ethnic backgrounds, and even create ones that represent persons with disabilities), they can be selected to resonate with certain audiences or to be inclusive in company messaging. Some companies have used AI avatars to provide sign-language interpretation or simplified explanations alongside main content, improving accessibility of communications.\nCustomer Service and Patient Engagement\nVirtual Patient Assistants: AI avatars can humanize these digital support tools. For example, instead of a text FAQ, a patient could interact with a virtual nurse avatar available on a patient portal or via a mobile app. This service could explain how to inject a medication, remind patients about refill schedules, and answer common questions about managing side effects – all in a comforting, visual manner. Because avatars can be available 24/7 and handle unlimited simultaneous sessions, they complement human-based call centers by handling routine inquiries. Importantly, an avatar can also escalate to a human or encourage contacting a doctor when needed. Alzheimer’s Foundation of America introduced an avatar named “Allison” to assist caregivers with information – a sign that healthcare organizations see promise in avatar companions for support.\nClinical Trial Education: Recruiting and retaining patients in clinical trials is challenging. Avatars could help explain trial procedures to patients in a consistent way, improving understanding and trust. A trial might use an avatar to walk a participant through the informed consent document, ensuring they grasp key points (the avatar can even quiz them interactively to confirm understanding). During the trial, avatars could be part of digital follow-ups (“How are you feeling after week 2? Here’s what to expect next…”). Since trials often happen across different countries, using an avatar that speaks the patient’s language natively is a big plus.\nTelehealth and Virtual Care: Healthcare providers might integrate avatars as front-end greeters or initial assessors in telehealth platforms. For minor or routine issues, an avatar could gather symptoms from a patient in conversational form (“What brings you in today?”) and either provide basic guidance or prepare a summary for the human doctor. Some telehealth apps already use chatbots for triage; adding an avatar face could make the experience less sterile. In sensitive areas like mental health, there have been studies showing some patients feel more comfortable initially talking to a virtual “person” than a real one (no fear of judgment). An empathetic-looking avatar could encourage patients to open up and then later transition to human care when needed. Woebot (a mental health chatbot) and similar tools use cartoon avatars; it’s conceivable that with advances in emotional AI, more realistic avatars could play a role in digital therapeutics (though caution is needed to avoid uncanny valley effects that could backfire in emotional situations).\nOther Industry Use Case (for reference)\nEducation: Schools and e-learning platforms are using avatars as tutors or lecture presenters (a professor can scale herself via an avatar to give basic lectures so she can focus on advanced interactive sessions in person).\nFinancial Services: Banks employ avatars in branches or apps for customer questions (e.g., “What’s the status of my loan?” answered by a smiling digital banker who can also visually show charts or forms).\nRetail & Hospitality: Hotel chains have tested lobby avatar kiosks for concierge info, and e-commerce sites have virtual sales agents that help customers find products.\nEntertainment: Virtual TV anchors, game streamers, and of course NPCs in games – avatars are increasingly content creators or characters. There are even AI-generated pop music idols (virtual singers).\nThe common thread is scalability of human touch – avatars bring a face and voice to AI, which can increase engagement across many domains.\nFor Lilly, the most immediate high-impact uses likely lie in the internal and HCP-facing realm (training, internal comms, HCP engagement) where regulatory risk is lower compared to direct patient interactions. However, as comfort and evidence build, patient-facing avatars could become part of patient support programs or disease awareness campaigns (with compliance and careful messaging oversight).\nOpportunities and Benefits\n​\nImplementing AI avatars offers several compelling benefits outlined below.\nScalability and Efficiency:\nAs noted, avatars allow you to produce content or handle interactions at scale, without linear cost increases. A single avatar can generate personalized videos for 100 or 100,000 people with minimal extra effort. This is ideal for pharma, which often needs to reach global audiences in many languages. Instead of maintaining large teams of translators, video producers, trainers in each region, a central team can deploy avatar content globally. This lowers cost per video/interaction dramatically – companies have seen cost reductions on the order of 10x for video production. In training, consistent avatar-based modules ensure everyone gets the same quality of instruction, avoiding variability of different trainers.\nEngagement and Learning Impact:\nHumans are wired to respond to faces and voices. Avatars, even if known to be AI, often garner more attention than text on a page. Early career professionals particularly prefer video content. So using avatars in internal communications can increase engagement rates – more people watching a policy update instead of ignoring an email. In external use, video messages can break through information overload better than PDF attachments. Studies in education show video with a human presenter can improve understanding and retention, and when that presenter is relatable (e.g., speaks the viewer’s language or has a comforting demeanor), it’s even more effective. Thus, avatars can improve training outcomes (e.g., better compliance adherence because employees absorbed the training), and marketing outcomes (better message recall among doctors who saw an avatar video about a drug vs. just reading a brochure).\nPersonalization and Localization:\nAvatars let you easily localize content – not just language but potentially cultural style (you might pick different avatar personas for different regions if appropriate). Personalization, as discussed, can make communications feel tailored. For example, an avatar video addressing a patient by name and referencing their specific treatment plan could make them feel seen and cared for by the company, potentially improving adherence. In internal settings, onboarding could include an avatar that mentions the new hire’s name and department, creating a more personalized welcome than a generic video.\nConsistency and Compliance:\nThis is a subtle but important benefit in regulated industries: when you use an AI system to deliver information, it will stick to the script. There’s less risk of an off-the-cuff remark or deviation that could be non-compliant. Once the medical/legal team approves the avatar’s script, guardrails, and/or behavior, you can deploy it widely confident that every viewer gets the approved message exactly. It’s easier to update content as well – if a safety warning needs adding, you edit the script and regenerate; you don’t need to schedule new shoots with an actor. Avatars also inherently will use the exact phrasing required (e.g., including all the necessary disclaimers verbatim). Of course, one must ensure the AI doesn’t hallucinate or go off-script – which is why most one-way avatar videos are tightly scripted, and interactive ones should be anchored to approved knowledge bases for sensitive info. But compared to human agents or trainers who might paraphrase or get questions wrong, avatars can provide consistent, controlled messaging.\nInnovation and Brand Image:\nUsing AI avatars – if done thoughtfully – can position Lilly as an innovator. It signals that the company is tech-forward and exploring new ways to communicate. This can have an employer branding benefit (attracting talent excited about innovation) and even an investor/public relations angle (showcasing adoption of digital transformation). For example, if Lilly uses a virtual digital human for a digital-only product launch event, it may garner positive media coverage for creativity. However, this must be balanced with sensitivity to how the audience will perceive it (one doesn’t want to appear as though replacing human touch with “bots” in patient care – messaging has to emphasize augmentation, not replacement).\n24/7 Availability and Speed:\nAvatars, unlike people, don’t require sleep or schedules. A virtual medical info avatar on a website can answer a doctor’s question at 2 AM when no MSL is available. An internal IT support avatar could handle routine questions over the weekend. This instant response potential increases productivity (employees aren’t stuck waiting for answers) and customer satisfaction (HCPs or patients get help when they need it). Furthermore, creating a new avatar video can be done in hours, meaning communications can go out faster. For instance, when there’s an urgent update (like new drug approval news or a safety bulletin), an avatar video can be generated and disseminated company-wide or to stakeholders on the same day – much faster than arranging a global conference call or subtitled video from an executive.\nCost Savings:\nWe touched on production cost savings. To quantify: making a 5-minute professional training video with live actors could cost tens of thousands of dollars (considering scriptwriting, filming crew, editing, talent fees, etc.), whereas with an avatar platform, it might just be the subscription cost or a few hundred dollars equivalent in usage. Over a year, if the company produces hundreds of videos, the savings are substantial. Additionally, travel costs can be saved if some training that used to be done via flying trainers around is replaced with avatar modules. Avatars can also reduce burden on human support staff by handling first-line queries (deflecting some volume away from call centers, which translates to cost savings or ability to redeploy staff to more complex tasks).\nNew Capabilities:\nAvatars can do things humans can’t, in a way. They can appear simultaneously in many places, as mentioned. They can also have instant knowledge of enormous datasets (if connected to AI). For example, an avatar medical assistant could instantly recall data from thousands of clinical trials to answer a question, something a human would have to research. In interactive training, an avatar could adapt the scenario on the fly to the learner’s performance (thanks to AI), providing a level of adaptive training that one human role-play partner might not manage consistently. These new capabilities – such as an avatar noticing that a learner is struggling and dynamically adjusting difficulty – could improve efficacy of programs.\nChallenges and Risks\n​\nAlong with opportunities come challenges and risks. Implementing AI avatars is not without potential pitfalls. It’s crucial to be aware of these challenges and plan mitigation strategies.\nAccuracy and Hallucination:\nIf an avatar is powered by AI (especially generative models like GPT) for live conversation, it might hallucinate incorrect answers or say something that is not desired. In pharma, an avatar giving wrong medical information or an unapproved off-label suggestion would be a serious issue. This risk is mitigated by keeping sensitive applications script-based or tightly controlling the AI’s knowledge domain. For instance, one would use a closed QA database for a medical FAQ, rather than a free-roaming internet model. Testing and validation of avatar responses is needed, similar to validating a chatbot. For one-way videos, the risk is low since content is pre-approved, but for interactive avatars, a robust content moderation and fail-safe mechanism is needed (e.g., the avatar should defer or escalate to human if unsure or asked something out of scope).\nUncanny Valley and User Acceptance:\nWhile avatars are highly realistic now, they can sometimes fall into the “uncanny valley” – where they look almost human but something is off, causing discomfort. Early experiences with stiff or emotionless avatars can turn off users. Even when well done, some users might find it creepy to interact with a fake human, especially if they are not informed. Transparency is key: users should know they are interacting with an AI avatar, not a real person (e.g., an on-screen label or introduction). Over time, as people get accustomed (just as everyone got used to voice assistants), this concern may fade. But for now, change management is needed. Internally, explain why the company is using avatars (“to save time, to provide multilingual support, etc.”) to avoid rumors of “robots replacing us” or pushback that it’s impersonal. Externally, gauge audience reactions through pilots – maybe HCPs love the convenience of an avatar rep, or maybe they feel it’s too impersonal compared to a human rep. Adjust strategy accordingly. The design of the avatar also matters; some companies deliberately choose a more obviously animated style to avoid uncanny valley, while others go for full realism. Both pre-recorded avatar videos and interactive Digital People can be considered regulated content, so be sure to follow all existing policies and procedures for content, especially externally-facing content.\nConsent and Likeness Rights:\nIf you create an avatar of a real person (e.g., an employee or actor), you must have their explicit consent and probably a contract outlining usage. There have been cases of actors worrying about losing control of their digital likeness. Synthesia addressed this by compensating actors and requiring consent for any custom avatars. Lilly should ensure any patient or HCP figures used in avatar form have signed off. Using a popular public figure as an avatar without permission is ethically wrong and may be illegal (and most platforms prevent it).\nDeepfake Misuse:\nThe same tech that powers avatars can be misused for disinformation. While our company would never intend that, being associated with “deepfake tech” can draw scrutiny. It’s important to position the use as “synthetic media for positive and authorized purposes”. Following industry ethics guidelines (there are emerging frameworks for synthetic media transparency) is wise. For example, including an unobtrusive watermark or a statement at the end like “This video was generated using AI” can be considered for transparency, especially in external comms.\nData Privacy:\nInteractive avatars will collect data (e.g., video of users if the avatar “sees” them, conversation logs, etc.). All this needs to be handled under privacy laws (HIPAA if any health info, GDPR in EU, etc.). Data should be secured and not used beyond the stated purpose. If patients talk to an avatar about their condition, that’s sensitive personal health information requiring proper safeguards.\nBias and Inclusion:\nAI models might carry biases (e.g., an avatar’s speech recognition might struggle with certain accents, or its responses might inadvertently be skewed). It’s important to test with diverse user groups. Also, offering a variety of avatar ethnicities and genders for user choice can be a way to be inclusive (some research in customer service bots suggests people prefer an avatar they identify with). However, one must avoid stereotypes (e.g., not always making the nurse avatar female or the executive avatar male – break stereotypical representations).\nEmployee concerns:\nIn some cases, new technology can cause distraction and concern. While the intent of a use case may be to augment existing staff, always consider proactively communicating how roles will evolve.\nQuality and Technical Limitations:\nAlthough improving rapidly, avatars can still have occasional glitches – maybe a pronunciation error for a new drug name, or slightly mismatched lip sync on a difficult word. Visual quality might not perfectly match a professional studio video (especially if internet bandwidth is an issue for streaming interactive avatars). In cases where top-notch polish is required (e.g., a broadcast TV commercial), current avatar tech might not fully replace human footage (though it’s getting close). Also, generating very long videos can be time-consuming or costly on some platforms. There might be limitations like avatars not being able to show highly dynamic movements (running, complex interactions with objects) – they are mostly standing or sitting and gesturing. For most corporate needs these are fine, but we must set expectations that avatars have a “presentation style” which might be somewhat stiff if overused. Keeping avatar videos concise and to the point helps. On the technical side, integration into legacy systems can be a challenge – for example, making an avatar appear within an existing mobile app might require custom dev work or using an SDK, which may require custom development support and possibly waiting on vendor capabilities (e.g., an offline mode if internet is down, etc.). Ensuring you have support and possibly fallback options (text or human chat) is prudent when deploying new tech.\nInfrastructure and Cost Considerations:\nWhile individual video generation is cheap, every technology has some runtime costs. High-quality avatars, especially interactive ones, often require GPU services. If using a cloud API extensively, those costs can add up (though likely still less than human labor equivalents). There’s also the question of whether to centralize avatar generation or allow many users to do it – a large company might need governance to avoid a patchwork of disjointed avatar experiences. License costs for enterprise plans (Synthesia, etc.) should be factored. Also, network infrastructure: streaming avatars (like a live conversation) means video data streaming; Tech@Lilly will need to ensure bandwidth and latency are acceptable, especially for global usage. If deploying via Azure or another cloud, ensure compliance with where data is processed (some may require regional data centers, etc., particularly for health data).\nRegulatory and Public Perception:\nIn pharma, any promotional communication is potentially subject to regulatory scrutiny (FDA, EMA, etc.). It’s uncharted territory how regulators will view AI-generated spokespeople. The content itself still must meet all regulations (fair balance, no off-label, etc.), which is straightforward if we control the script. But one might consider informing regulators or adding disclaimers that “This is a fictional animated presenter” in consumer content to avoid any concern of deception. Another angle: if an avatar answers questions live, ensuring it doesn’t inadvertently create an “adverse event report” that gets missed (e.g., if a patient tells the avatar about a side effect, does that need to be reported?) – processes must be in place as they would for any chatbot intake. On public perception, Lilly must avoid missteps like using an avatar to represent a patient without disclosure. A recent example outside pharma: a state media outlet used Synthesia avatars to deliver political propaganda, which caused controversy. Synthesia has since tightened policies. The lesson: always be transparent and truthful in usage. Use avatars to supplement human communication, not to masquerade deceptively. If a commercial, for example, shows an avatar as a “doctor” testimonial, consider indicating that it’s a virtual depiction unless one explicitly wants to simulate a fictional scenario (like an actor would in a dramatization).\nMany of these risks can be managed with proper governance, testing, and a human-in-the-loop approach. For instance, keep humans supervising avatar interactions in early deployments (an avatar could flag a live agent to step in for complex queries). Maintain logs of avatar outputs for auditing (especially in medical info contexts). And engage ethicists or compliance early in the project design.\nAdoption Strategies\n​\nTo successfully adopt AI avatars or Digital People technology, a phased and strategic approach is advisable. We propose aligning with the Tech@Lilly Innovation Pipeline framework – moving from early innovation stages like Alpha and Beta, to small-scale real-world deployment, before scaling with a general release. This innovation process is designed to be both rapid and controlled.\nGiven the breadth of possibilities, it’s wise to prioritize use cases based on risk and business value. Throughout these stages, cross-functional collaboration is important. Involve Tech@Lilly, Quality, Legal, and subject matter experts in the function benefiting from the technology. Also, get feedback from end-users as early as possible.\nFinally, stay aware of emerging trends and rapid improvement as the technology continues to mature. Examples:\nConvergence with AR/VR (AR glasses could project likenesses of digital coaches in front of an employee during some hands on learning of a practice or procedure).\nImprovements in AI agents (avatars becoming more autonomous in performing tasks, not just talking).\nBeing prepared to integrate those when ready will keep the company at the forefront of digital innovation in the industry.\nFuture Outlook\n​\nDigital People and pre-recorded Avatar video technology is advancing rapidly. Soon it will become nearly impossible to determine if the person you see on a screen is real or synthetic.\nLooking ahead 2–5 years, we can expect:\nNear-Photorealism and Beyond: Avatars will become indistinguishable from real humans on camera. Companies like Synthesia are already investing in next-gen models (e.g., their partnership with Shutterstock to train **“EXPRESS-2” models for a new generation of avatars). This will improve subtle details like hair, hand movements, clothing physics, and reducing any visual artifacts. Full-body avatars will progress to walking and interacting naturally with props or environments. For corporate use, this simply means higher quality content that viewers will find credible and engaging.\nReal-Time Multilingual Conversations: We will likely see avatars that can instantly translate speech in one language to another while preserving the speaker’s voice and facial expressions. Early versions exist (e.g., NVIDIA demoed real-time translation of a talking video from English to Spanish with correct lip movements). In a few years, it will likely be common for live speakers to be “avatarized” in real time to deliver the message in all languages simultaneously on screen. This could be huge for global events or multilingual training – a single presenter can effectively speak everyone’s language through their avatar. Microsoft’s research in speech-to-speech translation and startups like HeyGen working on live dubbing indicate this is close.\nGreater Autonomy and Agency: Future avatars will not just be reactive, but proactive agents. With more integration to enterprise systems and more sophisticated AI agents, avatars could perform tasks. For example, a virtual medical assistant avatar might notice a patient’s refill is due and proactively come up (via a phone app) to remind them and offer to place an order or schedule a pharmacy delivery, completing the action within the conversation. Digital People, driven by AI agent technology, could coordinate with each other too – one can imagine a team of digital agents handling complex workflows (one talks to the user, another fetches data in background, etc.). In games and simulations, multiple AI NPC avatars may converse among themselves, making scenarios more realistic (Convai demonstrated NPCs discussing and collaborating in a game world). In a business, maybe two avatar advisors (one representing finance and one legal) could jointly brief a user on a matter, each with expertise.\nPersonalized Appearance via Generative AI: We will see more user control to create custom avatar appearances with simple inputs. In the future, it may be common practice for each employee to have their own digital clone, which may attend meetings, delivery presentations, or even provide another employee career advice. Also, “Prompt-based” avatar generation will improve, meaning you can generate a completely unique digital spokesperson that matches your brand persona in seconds (no actors needed at all). These generative avatars will then be animated by the usual pipelines. We are already seeing companies like HeyGen offer ‘cross-modal cloning’ features – e.g., creating an avatar of a person using only a sample voice recording and a photo. This could allow quick creation of avatars of real staff with minimal input (but will need careful consent workflows). It could also enable dynamic avatars that change appearance contextually (imagine an avatar that visually appears tired or wearing winter clothes if talking about winter health, etc., done automatically).\nBlending Virtual and Physical (XR): Avatars will increasingly step off the 2D screen. In AR (augmented reality), you might have an avatar appear in your room via glasses or phone, guiding you through a procedure (like assembling a device or injecting a medicine). In VR, training programs will use AI characters as role-players in fully immersive environments (for example, practicing an emergency response in a virtual hospital with AI avatar patients and colleagues). Pharma companies might, in future, use AR avatar reps – instead of a Zoom call, a doctor wearing AR glasses could see a life-size avatar of the pharma rep in their office virtually for a discussion. Companies like Meta are heavily researching ultra-realistic avatars for VR telepresence; by the time devices like Apple’s Vision Pro become common, having your “digital twin” join a meeting might be normalized. It will be important to ensure these avatars maintain the same compliance messaging in those mediums as well (which is another reason to have them AI-driven rather than entirely controlled by users).\nIndustry Regulations and Standards: We can anticipate that governments and industry bodies will issue guidelines or even regulations on AI-generated media. This might include requirements to disclose AI content in certain contexts (especially in political or public communications). Advertising standards might adapt – e.g., requiring a disclaimer if a “person” endorsing a product is not real. The pharma industry might create best practices specifically for avatar usage in patient interactions to ensure trust (perhaps an adaptation of existing chatbot guidelines). Being ahead of this by self-imposing transparency will be wise. On the flip side, as it becomes mainstream, people will also become more accepting of AI avatars, just as chatbots became ubiquitous. We may also see certifications or seals (maybe an avatar platform gets certified for healthcare information delivery if it meets certain accuracy standards).\nConvergence with Voice and Robotics: While this report focuses on Digital People, note the synergy with voice assistants and even physical robots. The same AI driving a Digital Person could drive a humanoid robot or a customer service animatronic kiosk.\nIncreased Use in Healthcare Delivery: If we look at the WHO’s Florence in 2022 as an early example, by 2030 we might commonly have “digital health workers” supplementing human healthcare, endorsed by major organizations. This could help address personnel shortages by handling routine interactions. Pharma companies may eventually partner in creating validated avatars that can guide patients on proper use of medicines or lifestyle changes. It’s not far-fetched that clinical guidelines or patient education materials might come with an official Digital Person that any clinic can use to educate patients in a standardized way.\nIn preparing for the future, Lilly should remain agile in adopting updates. It might also consider shaping the future – e.g., participating in industry consortia on AI avatars, or even developing bespoke in-house capabilities for strategic advantage, if warranted.\nConclusion\n​\nDigital People and AI avatars are rapidly transitioning from novelty to a practical tool across enterprise functions. For Lilly, they offer a new medium to communicate scientific information, engage with stakeholders, and train and support the workforce more effectively. By starting with targeted use cases and scaling carefully with proper oversight, we can reap the efficiency and engagement benefits while managing risks. This technology will only get more powerful and more prevalent; as industry leaders and early adopters, we will have the advantage of experience and internal capability when avatars become a standard interface in business.\nSources\n​\nainvest.com\nainvest.com/news/synthesia-ai-avatars-drive-50-efficiency-gains-fortune-100-companies-2506\nbusinesswire.com\nbusinesswire.com/news/home/20240927126293/en/Soul-Machines-Expands-AI-Assistant-Capabilities-With-New-Advanced-Object-Recognition-and-Memory-Features-Powered-by-Its-Patented-Experiential-AI-Technology\ncutter.com/article/vr-applications-healthcare-and-medicine-digital-humans\nd-id.com/news\ndeveloper.nvidia.com/blog/spotlight-uneeq-revolutionizes-customer-engagement-with-ai-powered-digital-humans\ndigitalhumans.com\ndigitalhumans.com/features/integrations-and-deployment\ndigitalhumans.com/features/synanim\ndigitalhumans.com/platform\nforbes.com/sites/gilpress/2025/03/05/microsoft-transforms-communications-with-agentic-ai-avatars-from-d-id\nheygen.com\nheygen.com/news/latest-drops-fall-2024\nintelligenthq.com\nintelligenthq.com/time-recognises-d-ids-ai-avatars-as-best-innovation-of-2024\nnvidianews.nvidia.com\nnvidianews.nvidia.com/news/ace-avatar-cloud-engine-microservices\npharmaphorum.com\npharmaphorum.com/news/meet-florence-whos-ai-powered-digital-health-worker\nsoulmachines.com\nspringfieldherald.news\nsynthesia.io/blog/category/synthesia-news\nsynthesia.io/case-studies\ntechcommunity.microsoft.com\ntechcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/azure-ai-speech-announces-public-preview-of-text-to-speech-avatar/3981448\ntechcrunch.com/2024/10/31/d-id-launches-new-high-quality-avatars-capable-of-real-time-conversations\nventurebeat.com/ai/synthesia-announces-platform-update-with-interactive-ai-videos-full-body-avatars\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\ninnovation\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n📡 Emerging Tech\nNext\nAI Speech\nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction\nHow AI Avatars Work\nAI Training Techniques\nTraditional Avatars vs AI Avatars\nCapabilities and Features of Modern AI Avatars\nTop Vendors and Key Players\nSecondary “Wrapper” Vendors: Pattern & Pitfalls\nApplications in Pharma (and Other Industries)\nOpportunities and Benefits\nChallenges and Risks\nAdoption Strategies\nFuture Outlook\nConclusion\nSources\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

This report represents a point-in-time assessment based on available information through November 2025.\nINTERNAL USE ONLY - CONTAINS AI GENERATED CONTENT\nThis containts AI generated content and includes insights from over 1,000 publicly available sources including peer-reviewed publications, regulatory documents, industry reports, vendor specifications, and market analyses. The content represents AI-assisted compilation and interpretation of publicly accessible information current as of November 2025. This should not be distributed, reproduced, or shared outside the organization without explicit authorization from the author and appropriate leadership. The insights, analyses, and recommendations contained herein are intended to inform internal strategic discussions and should not be construed as official Eli Lilly positions or commitments.\nExecutive Summary\n​\nAI Speech has reached 'pharmaceutical-grade' maturity.\nAI speech represents far reaching opportunities, offering Eli Lilly solutions for voice-enabled documentation, clinical voice biomarkers, and conversational AI across the enterprise. The FDA issued groundbreaking guidance in January 2025 establishing risk-based frameworks for AI in drug development, while voice biomarker markets are projected to reach $5.4 billion by 2035. This creates an immediate 12-month window for strategic positioning before widespread industry adoption accelerates.\nWhy Now\nThree converging forces make 2025 the inflection point for pharmaceutical voice AI adoption. First, transformer-based speech models (OpenAI Whisper, Microsoft VALL-E 2) achieved human parity performance in 2024 with 95%+ medical terminology accuracy. Second, regulatory clarity emerged with FDA's January 2025 credibility assessment framework and EMA's September 2024 final guidance on AI in the medicinal product lifecycle. Third, proven ROI metrics demonstrate 40-70% time savings in clinical documentation, 50% reduction in adverse event processing time, and 200-12,000% first-year returns across implementations.\nThe Strategic Imperative\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals is concidered a leader in AI Speech amoungst competitors with a dedicated MIT voice biomarker program for neurological diseases, while Pfizer, GSK, and Sanofi deploy conversational AI for medical information services. Eli Lilly could leapfrog competitors by strategically deploying voice AI across high-value use cases: voice-enabled laboratory notebooks integrating with LIMS (16% data capture increase documented), hands-free GMP manufacturing documentation (99.86% accuracy with IoT integration), voice biomarkers for clinical trial endpoints in neuropsychiatry (80% detection accuracy for depression from 20 seconds of speech), and AI-powered medical information services (85% call deflection rates). The pharmaceutical voice AI market exhibits classic first-mover advantages with 85% of generative AI spend flowing to innovative startups over incumbents, suggesting rapid consolidation ahead.\nRisks and Mitigations\nVoice data constitutes Protected Health Information under HIPAA and special category data under GDPR Article 9, requiring explicit consent frameworks and privacy-by-design architectures. The FDA's August 2024 warning letter for an AI dosing algorithm that caused 10x pediatric overdose underscores the necessity for human-in-the-loop validation. Voice recognition algorithms trained on non-diverse datasets risk bias across accents and demographics, with 94% of depression voice studies having fewer than 100 participants. Mitigation strategies include federated learning architectures preserving data sovereignty (99% of centralized model quality while keeping data local), differential privacy implementations, comprehensive GxP validation protocols aligned with 21 CFR Part 11, and pilot programs with clearly defined success criteria before enterprise scaling.\nRecommendation for Lilly\nLeverage the Tech Innovation Pipeline framework for advanced speech technologies with structured Alpha, Beta, and Early Release phases to systematically prove value before enterprise commitment. Begin with exploratory Alpha experiments across diverse use cases: voice-enabled laboratory documentation systems, ambient clinical intelligence for field medical teams, digital voice biomarkers as exploratory endpoints, and conversational AI for patient engagement. Progress promising technologies through Beta pilots with defined success metrics and risk mitigation protocols, then advance validated solutions to Early Release with controlled user groups before considering enterprise scaling. Leverage a cross-functional review structure spanning Quality, Regulatory Affairs, Legal, Enterprise Business Architecture, and Medical Affairs to oversee the pipeline progression. Allow low-risk initiatives to progress quickly through the stages of innovation, acting as pathfinders for more strategic, higher-risk applications to follow. Allocate innovation funding with stage-gate investment decisions tied to demonstrated value and regulatory feasibility.\nWhat is AI speech technology\n​\nAI speech technology enables computers to understand human speech and generate human-like voices through machine learning, fundamentally transforming how pharmaceutical companies capture data, engage patients, and conduct research. At its core, the technology works bidirectionally: Speech-to-Text (STT) systems convert spoken words into written text that computers can process, while Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems transform written text into natural-sounding audio that humans can understand. Voice cloning extends these capabilities by capturing and replicating individual voice characteristics, enabling personalized patient communications and preservation of voice for medical conditions affecting speech.\nThe practical significance for pharmaceutical operations becomes clear in daily scenarios. A laboratory scientist wearing gloves in a biosafety cabinet can verbally dictate experimental observations directly into an electronic lab notebook without touching a keyboard, eliminating contamination risks and data transcription errors. A medical science liaison conducting a physician meeting can have the conversation automatically transcribed and structured into CRM-compliant documentation within seconds, reducing post-meeting administrative work from 45 minutes to 5 minutes. A clinical trial participant with Parkinson's disease can complete daily speech assessments on a smartphone, providing continuous disease progression monitoring without traveling to clinical sites. A quality control inspector on a manufacturing floor can verbally confirm batch parameters while maintaining hands-free GMP documentation compliance.\nModern AI speech systems fundamentally differ from older voice recognition technology\nthat required extensive training on individual voices and struggled with medical vocabulary. Today's transformer-based neural networks are pre-trained on millions of hours of diverse speech data, enabling them to understand medical terminology, pharmaceutical nomenclature, and scientific language out-of-the-box with 95-97% accuracy. The systems adapt to different accents, speaking styles, and acoustic environments without individual voice training. They process language contextually, understanding that \"two milligrams\" and \"2mg\" represent the same pharmaceutical dose, or that \"adverse event\" in regulatory context differs from casual usage of those words.\nThe technology stack comprises four integrated layers working seamlessly together. The acoustic layer captures raw audio and converts it to mathematical representations called spectrograms that preserve pitch, tone, and timing information. The linguistic layer applies natural language processing to understand grammar, context, and meaning within pharmaceutical domain-specific vocabularies. The integration layer connects to enterprise systems like LIMS, EHR, CRM, and quality management platforms, automatically populating structured data fields from conversational speech. The compliance layer ensures all voice interactions generate audit trails, electronic signatures, and documentation meeting FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and EU GMP requirements.\nThree deployment models address different pharmaceutical use cases. Cloud-based systems (Microsoft Azure Speech, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Amazon Transcribe Medical) offer the highest accuracy and continuous improvement through centralized learning, ideal for non-real-time applications like transcribing investigator meetings or processing adverse event call center recordings. On-premise systems deployed within Lilly data centers provide maximum data control and sovereignty, required for highly sensitive clinical trial data or proprietary research information subject to strict access controls. Edge deployment on mobile devices or manufacturing equipment enables real-time voice interaction without network connectivity, critical for manufacturing floor operations or field-based clinical research where internet access is unreliable.\nThe pharmaceutical industry specifically benefits from voice biomarker capabilities that extract health information directly from voice characteristics beyond the spoken words. Subtle changes in voice quality, pitch stability, speech rate, pause patterns, and articulatory precision correlate with neurological conditions (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ALS), mental health status (depression, anxiety, PTSD), and respiratory function (COPD, asthma, COVID-19). A 30-second speech sample analyzed by AI algorithms can predict mild cognitive impairment progression to Alzheimer's with 80% accuracy, detect depression from voice acoustics with similar accuracy, or screen for respiratory infection before symptoms emerge. These capabilities transform voice from a data input mechanism into a continuous, non-invasive diagnostic and monitoring tool.\nUnderstanding voice AI capabilities and limitations is essential for realistic deployment planning. The technology excels at structured tasks with clear vocabulary and context: transcribing standard operating procedures, documenting manufacturing batch records, capturing clinical trial visit notes, answering common medical information questions from predefined knowledge bases. It struggles with highly ambiguous context, novel drug names never encountered in training data, extreme background noise exceeding 85 decibels, or detecting subtle deception in patient-reported outcomes. Voice AI augments human expertise rather than replacing it, the optimal paradigm combines AI for rapid transcription and initial analysis with human review for final verification and nuanced interpretation.\nHow AI speech technology works\n​\nThe transformation of human speech into computer-processable information relies on sophisticated neural network architectures that have evolved dramatically over the past 18 months, with pharmaceutical applications benefiting from models specifically trained on medical terminology and clinical conversations. Understanding the technical architecture enables realistic assessment of capabilities, limitations, and integration requirements for pharmaceutical deployments.\nSignal processing and acoustic feature extraction\n​\nWhen someone speaks into a microphone, the analog sound wave is digitized at standard sampling rates of 16 kHz for telephony or 44-48 kHz for high-fidelity recording. The raw audio signal undergoes preprocessing to remove background noise, normalize volume levels, and enhance speech frequencies. The critical transformation converts time-domain audio waveforms into frequency-domain representations through Fourier analysis, producing spectrograms that visually represent which frequencies have energy at each time point. Modern systems use mel-scale spectrograms that emphasize frequency ranges most relevant to human speech perception, typically extracting 80-128 mel-frequency channels. These spectrograms become the input to neural networks, with each 30-second audio chunk converted to a two-dimensional image-like representation that the AI model processes.\nEarlier generation systems relied on hand-engineered acoustic features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) that captured specific audio characteristics known to be important for speech. Contemporary transformer-based models learn optimal feature representations automatically from raw spectrograms through self-supervised learning on massive unlabeled audio datasets. This architectural shift explains the dramatic accuracy improvements seen in 2024-2025, with models learning subtle patterns in audio that human engineers never explicitly programmed. For pharmaceutical applications, this means the systems automatically adapt to specialized acoustic environments like cleanrooms with HEPA filter background noise or clinical examination rooms with medical equipment sounds.\nTransformer architectures for speech recognition\n​\nOpenAI Whisper\nrepresents the current state-of-the-art for pharmaceutical speech-to-text applications, with Whisper Large-v3 (released November 2023) and Whisper Turbo (2024 optimization) offering the best combination of accuracy and speed. The architecture employs a transformer encoder-decoder design where the encoder processes the mel-spectrogram input through stacked transformer blocks with self-attention mechanisms, building progressively higher-level representations of the audio content. The decoder generates text output autoregressively, predicting one token at a time while attending to both the encoded audio features and previously generated text. Training on 5 million hours of labeled audio data across 100+ languages enables zero-shot capabilities on pharmaceutical terminology without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, though custom vocabulary additions improve accuracy for novel drug names.\nWhisper achieves 50% fewer errors than previous generation models across diverse datasets, with Word Error Rates under 5% on clean speech and 10-15% on conversational clinical interactions. The multilingual architecture uses special tokens to specify source language and task (transcription vs. translation), enabling a single model to handle Lilly's global operations across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The automatic language detection capability eliminates the need to pre-specify languages in multinational clinical trials. However, Whisper exhibits a 1.4% hallucination rate where it generates plausible but non-existent content in silent audio segments -  critical issue for pharmaceutical documentation requiring perfect fidelity.\nConformer architectures\ncombine convolutional neural networks with transformer attention mechanisms, leveraging CNNs to capture local audio patterns (like phoneme transitions) while transformers model long-range dependencies (like sentence-level prosody). Google's Conformer implementations and Apple's edge-optimized versions demonstrate significant efficiency improvements, with Apple achieving 5.26x real-time speed (19% Real-Time Factor) on mobile processors - fast enough for instantaneous transcription on iPads used in clinical trials. AssemblyAI's Universal-1 model built on Conformer architecture provides pharmaceutical-grade medical conversation models with enhanced accuracy on clinical terminology, doctor-patient dialogues, and adverse event descriptions.\nFor real-time applications like voice-enabled manufacturing documentation or live medical information call transcription, streaming architectures process audio in overlapping chunks, producing transcription with under 300 milliseconds of latency. Deepgram Nova-2 achieves sub-100ms recognition latency (faster than human reaction time), enabling natural conversational flows in AI assistants for patient engagement or medical affairs applications. The technical challenge involves look-ahead limitations: streaming models cannot use future audio context when transcribing the current word, slightly reducing accuracy compared to batch processing of complete utterances.\nNeural text-to-speech synthesis\n​\nRecent breakthroughs in TTS enable pharmaceutical companies to generate natural-sounding patient communications, multilingual training materials, and accessible content from written documentation.\nMicrosoft VALL-E 2\nachieved the first confirmed human parity performance in June 2024, meaning listeners cannot distinguish AI-generated speech from human recordings. The architecture uses neural codec language models that treat audio as a sequence of discrete tokens similar to how language models treat text. Audio is first compressed using EnCodec into hierarchical representations at multiple bitrates, creating 8 quantization layers that capture both coarse structure (phonetics) and fine acoustic details (voice timbre, prosody). A large transformer language model then learns to generate these audio tokens conditioned on input text and a 3-second reference audio sample.\nTwo architectural innovations enable the human parity result. Repetition Aware Sampling refines the standard nucleus sampling algorithm used to select the next audio token, accounting for repetition patterns in the generation history to prevent infinite loops and stuttering artifacts that plagued earlier models. Grouped Code Modeling treats multiple consecutive audio tokens as atomic units, dramatically shortening the sequence length the model must predict, accelerating inference speed while maintaining fidelity. Training on 60,000 hours of English speech provides the model with sufficient coverage of speaking styles, emotions, and acoustic variations to generalize to new speakers with minimal prompting.\nFor pharmaceutical applications, this enables zero-shot voice cloning for personalized patient communications - recording a brief audio sample from a key opinion leader allows generating derivative content in their voice for educational materials, provided appropriate consent and ethical frameworks are in place. More immediately practical, modern TTS generates patient information in 60+ languages with regionally appropriate accents, addressing health equity requirements for diverse clinical trial populations and global commercial markets. The Mean Opinion Score benchmark measuring perceived naturalness shows current systems achieving 4.3-4.5 out of 5.0 (where 4.5+ represents \"sounds like a human\"), compared to 3.0-3.5 for older TTS systems with robotic qualities.\nDiffusion and flow-matching models\nrepresent an emerging alternative to autoregressive generation. These models iteratively refine random noise into high-quality speech spectrograms through a learned denoising process, similar to how diffusion models generate images in DALL-E or Stable Diffusion. DiTTo-TTS and F5-TTS (2024 models) demonstrate that Diffusion Transformer architectures outperform traditional U-Net designs, producing more natural prosody and fewer artifacts. The variable-length modeling capability handles pharmaceutical content of arbitrary duration, from short patient notifications to hour-long training narrations, without quality degradation. Non-autoregressive generation allows parallel processing of the entire utterance simultaneously rather than sequentially, reducing latency from seconds to under 100 milliseconds - crucial for real-time voice interaction in clinical call centers or patient engagement chatbots.\nSpeech-to-Speech vs STT/TTS Pipeline Architectures\nSpeech-to-Speech models dominate over pipleine architectures for natual language conversation interatction, with 2-3x lower latency\n, however challenges abound for regulated applications, primarily because regulated deployments demand auditability, error traceability, and multi-stage safety verification that modular systems uniquely provide. While 2024-2025 brought commercial S2S breakthroughs with GPT RealTime Voice, GPT4o, and Gemini Live, high-risk deployments may continue to favor STT > LLM > TTS pipelines for clinical documentation, medication ordering, and diagnostic applications where regulatory compliance and patient safety outweigh conversational naturalness.\nThis creates a clear architectural divide:\nConsumer voice AI is rapidly adopting end-to-end S2S models for their superior latency and prosody preservation, while pharmaceutical applications continue investing in pipeline systems that achieve 93-99% accuracy on medical terminology through specialized ASR models, enable FDA-mandated audit trails at each processing stage, and integrate clinical decision support to prevent medication errors - features nearly impossible to implement in monolithic S2S architectures.\nThe pharmaceutical sector's unique constraints - 25% of medication errors involve drug name confusion, FDA transparency requirements for AI medical devices, HIPAA compliance mandates, and the life-or-death consequences of transcription mistakes fundamentally favor architectures where errors can be isolated, verified, and corrected at multiple checkpoints rather than generated in a single black-box forward pass.\nDirect speech-to-speech models deliver speed but sacrifice pharmaceutical safety requirements\n​\nEnd-to-end S2S models represent a paradigm shift from cascade systems, directly mapping source speech to target speech without intermediate text representation. Google's Translatotron 3 (2024) surpassed cascade models on translation benchmarks, while Microsoft's VALL-E 2 achieved human parity on zero-shot text-to-speech with 4.2% word error rate matching ground truth performance. Meta's SeamlessM4T v2 supports 101 - 36 languages with 20% BLEU improvements over previous state-of-the-art, demonstrating the technical maturity of S2S architectures.\nLatency advantages create the strongest S2S value proposition.\nKyutai's Moshi demonstrates 160ms response time compared to 510ms for optimized pipelines, approaching the 230ms human conversation baseline. OpenAI's Realtime API averages 232ms audio-to-audio response, while SpeechGPT 2.0 achieves sub-200ms latency in practical tests - 3x faster than typical pipeline implementations (500-4000ms). This speed advantage enables natural full-duplex conversations with fluid interruption handling impossible in serial pipeline processing.\nParalinguistic preservation represents S2S models' second major strength.\nAudioLM's hierarchical tokenization separates semantic content from acoustic characteristics, maintaining speaker identity, prosody, and emotional tone across 60,000 hours of training data. Translatotron 2 preserves voice characteristics across language translation turns without segmentation, while SpeechGPT 2.0 offers multi-emotion, multi-style control including rap, drama, whisper, and robot modes through 750bps ultra-low bitrate codecs that jointly model semantics and acoustics.\nHowever, pharmaceutical applications reveal critical S2S limitations that overshadow these benefits. The monolithic architecture creates a black box issue, a concern for FDA's 2024 guidance requiring \"transparent, non-complex algorithms\" allowing providers to \"independently review the basis for recommendations.\" When a medication name is misheard - distinguishing \"epinephrine\" from \"ephedrine,\" or \"Celebrex\" from \"Celexa\" S2S systems provide no mechanism to identify whether acoustic confusion or language model error caused the mistake, making root cause analysis and correction impossible.\nHallucinations pose significate risks.\nS2S models can generate plausible-sounding but non-existent information, a well-documented phenomenon where models add phrases from training data like \"subtitles by Jane Doe\" or confabulate medical terms. In medication ordering, where 25% of errors involve drug name confusion and wrong medications can cause patient death, this single-point-of-failure architecture lacks the multiple verification checkpoints pharmaceutical safety demands.\nTraining S2S models for medical applications faces data scarcity challenges. While AudioPaLM trained on thousands of hours across 100+ languages and VALL-E used 60,000 hours of English speech, medical-specific S2S models remain largely theoretical with limited production deployments. Current S2S systems show 35-65% word error rates on medical terminology without specialized fine-tuning - unacceptable when clinical standards require sub-5% error rates for patient safety.\nPipeline architectures achieve medical-grade accuracy through specialized components and modular optimization\n​\nThe modular STT -> LLM -> TTS pipeline remains the production standard for pharmaceutical voice AI in 2024-2025, with market leaders universally adopting this architecture: Nuance DAX Copilot, Suki Assistant, Abridge, and Nabla Copilot all use pipeline approaches for clinical documentation serving major health systems like Mass General Brigham and Epic EHR integrations.\nMedical-specific ASR models deliver accuracy S2S systems cannot match.\nDeepgram Nova-3 Medical achieves 63.7% improvement in word error rate over competitors with 4% keyword error rate - half the errors of general systems on clinical terminology. Speechmatics Medical Model reaches 93% real-world accuracy with 50% fewer errors on medical terms versus next-best systems. AssemblyAI's Slam-1 demonstrates 66% reduction in missed medical entity rates with 72% preference in blind human evaluations, supporting up to 1,000 domain-specific terms via prompting for pharmaceutical names, procedure codes, and anatomical references.\nThis specialization extends beyond English. Whisper medical adaptations achieve 0.985% WER on LibriSpeech after fine-tuning, while maintaining multilingual capabilities across 98 languages. Companies like Nabla invested $5M and three years on 7,000 hours of annotated medical encounters to suppress hallucinations and improve terminology accuracy - investment levels impossible to replicate for monolithic S2S systems where component-level optimization is impossible.\nStreaming optimizations reduce pipeline latency to competitive levels.\nOptimized implementations using Deepgram Nova (100ms), GPT-4o-mini (200ms first token), and Cartesia Sonic TTS (90ms time-to-first-byte) achieve 465ms end-to-end latency - approaching S2S performance while maintaining modular advantages. Voice AI platforms like Vapi and Synthflow consistently deliver sub-800ms response times through parallel processing where VAD, STT, and API prefetching execute concurrently rather than serially.\nModern pipeline architectures implement sophisticated concurrent execution graphs that eliminate serial bottlenecks: sentence-level streaming sends partial LLM outputs to TTS before generation completes; predictive prefetching loads customer data on caller ID; speculative processing starts likely operations early. This transforms the mental model from serial chains to parallel graphs, with independent tasks executing simultaneously across STT, VAD, LLM reasoning, API calls, retrieval, and audio buffering stages.\nComponent swapping enables continuous improvement impossible in S2S systems.\nWhen Deepgram releases Nova-3 with 30% WER reduction, pipeline architectures upgrade ASR immediately without touching LLM or TTS components. Medical facilities can deploy GPT-4 for complex reasoning while using GPT-4o-mini for simple queries, mixing models by use case. TTS can switch between ElevenLabs (naturalness), Cartesia (speed), or Deepgram (enterprise balance) based on application requirements - flexibility that monolithic S2S architectures fundamentally cannot provide.\nIntegration with existing pharmaceutical infrastructure represents another decisive pipeline advantage. LLMs natively support function calling for CRM lookups, real-time inventory checks, and EHR data retrieval during conversations. RAG integration with medical knowledge bases using FAISS vector search enables evidence-based responses grounded in current medical literature. Clinical decision support systems intercept text outputs to verify medication indications, check dose ranges, flag drug-drug interactions, and alert on allergy contraindications - safety mechanisms requiring structured text that S2S's direct audio-to-audio processing bypasses.\nHybrid approaches combining strengths remain largely theoretical for pharmaceutical applications\n​\nWhile hybrid architectures theoretically combine S2S speed with pipeline safety, pharmaceutical implementations show minimal adoption of true hybrid systems. The regulatory burden of validating two parallel processing paths, the engineering complexity of fallback mechanisms, and the difficulty determining when to use which approach create practical barriers outweighing theoretical benefits.\nProposed hybrid patterns include risk-based routing\n: using S2S for low-risk patient engagement (appointment scheduling, general health information) while defaulting to pipelines for any clinical decision-making, medication advice, or symptom triage. However, real-world deployments reveal challenges in boundary detection - conversations naturally drift from administrative topics to medical questions, requiring dynamic switching that introduces latency and complexity.\nCascaded systems using S2S for specific sub-tasks\nwithin larger pipelines show more promise. AudioLM could handle voice cloning and speaker identity preservation while pipeline NLP performs medical entity recognition and clinical reasoning. This compartmentalized approach maintains audit trails and safety verification while leveraging S2S strengths for acoustic processing - though current pharmaceutical systems rarely implement this architecture, suggesting practical challenges exceed theoretical benefits.\nFallback mechanisms from S2S to pipeline during uncertainty add robustness but could defeat S2S's primary latency advantage. When an S2S model expresses low confidence on a drug name, falling back to pipeline verification adds 500-1000ms delay could be worse than using pipelines throughout. Some use cases may prove practical for \"hybrid\" approach. However, simply choosing pipeline for pharmaceutical applications and reserving S2S for low-risk voice interfaces, rather than attempting to combine both within single systems may be best for a given implementation.\nThe Accuracy-Latency Tradeoff\n​\nLatency measurements show\nS2S models deliver 2-3x faster response times\nacross consistent benchmarks. Moshi achieves 160ms, OpenAI Realtime API averages 232ms, and SpeechGPT 2.0 reaches sub-200ms all approaching human conversation's 230ms baseline. In contrast, typical production pipelines range from 500-4000ms depending on optimization level, with best-in-class implementations achieving 465-812ms through aggressive streaming and parallel processing.\nHowever, accuracy metrics favor pipelines by substantial margins for medical applications.* Medical-specific pipeline ASR achieves 5-10% WER (90-95% accuracy) on clinical conversations compared to 35-65% WER for general S2S models on medical content. Specialized systems like Deepgram Nova-3 Medical reach 4% keyword error rate on pharmaceutical terms - critical when distinguishing \"hydroxyzine\" (antihistamine) from \"hydralazine\" (blood pressure medication) can mean life or death.\nComputational requirements differ substantially between architectures.\nS2S models typically require larger unified models (1-2B parameters) with higher GPU memory demands - AudioPaLM uses 600M parameter Conformers, while medical pipeline ASR runs efficiently on 4-8GB consumer GPUs. Training requirements also diverge: S2S needs 60,000+ hours of parallel speech-speech data (VALL-E, AudioLM), while pipeline components fine-tune independently on smaller domain-specific datasets - Whisper medical adaptations use 7,000 hours versus millions required for general S2S.\nVoice quality metrics measured by Mean Opinion Score reveal\nTTS components in pipelines match or exceed S2S output quality\n. ElevenLabs achieves 81.97% pronunciation accuracy versus 77.30% for OpenAI systems, with 44.98% high naturalness scores and only 5% hallucination rates compared to 10% for competitors. VALL-E 2 reaches human parity at 4.5 MOS, while modern pipeline TTS from Cartesia Sonic achieves 40-95ms model latency - faster than many S2S systems' total response time.\nReal-time factor (RTF) measurements for scalability\nshow pipelines handle concurrent users more efficiently through independent component scaling. A single LLM instance serves multiple STT and TTS streams, while S2S models require dedicated resources per conversation. KV cache memory in LLMs scales linearly (10 concurrent requests need ~122GB for LLaMA-2 13B), but pipelines distribute this load across specialized hardware optimized per stage - ASR on inference servers, LLM on GPU clusters, TTS on edge devices impossible in monolithic S2S architectures.\nRecent S2S Developments\n​\n2024-2025 brought major S2S commercial launches that dramatically advanced consumer voice AI.\nOpenAI's GPT-4o Advanced Voice Mode\n(May 2024 unveiling, September rollout) delivers native multimodal audio sensing emotional intonations with interruption handling, offering 9 voice options and custom instructions via natural language. Google's Gemini Live (August 2024) provides free-tier conversational AI with 10+ emotionally expressive voices, while Gemini 2.5 (February 2025) adds real-time audio-video understanding with style control across 24+ languages and SynthID watermarking.\nMicrosoft Azure AI Speech's 2024-2025 releases\nillustrate enterprise focus on pipeline optimization rather than S2S: Personal Voice 2.1 offers zero-shot TTS requiring only seconds of audio for voice cloning across 100+ languages; Fast Transcription API delivers 10-minute audio transcribed in 15 seconds; Voice Live API (GA 2025) provides all-in-one STT + GenAI + TTS through a single low-latency interface. These remain modular pipeline services despite unified API presentation, maintaining component-level control enterprises demand.\nMeta's SeamlessM4T v2 publication in Nature (2024)\nwith 20% BLEU improvements and 2-second latency represents S2S research breakthroughs, but real-world pharmaceutical implementations remain absent from literature. Searches for \"S2S pharmaceutical deployment\" or \"end-to-end speech clinical documentation\" yield no production case studies, while pipeline systems dominate published healthcare AI implementations - suggesting a research-practice gap where academic S2S advances haven't translated to pharmaceutical adoption.\nTraining methods and transfer learning\n​\nModern speech AI leverages transfer learning paradigms where large foundation models pre-trained on general domain data are adapted to pharmaceutical contexts with relatively modest amounts of domain-specific training examples.\nSelf-supervised learning\nenables training on unlabeled audio by creating artificial prediction tasks: HuBERT (Hidden Unit BERT) masks portions of audio and trains the model to predict the missing segments, while wav2vec 2.0 learns to discriminate between true future audio frames and contrastive negative samples. These pre-training objectives force the model to learn general acoustic and linguistic representations transferable to downstream tasks.\nFor Lilly-specific customization, several adaptation strategies balance accuracy improvements against resource requirements and ongoing maintenance.\nCustom vocabulary augmentation\nadds pharmaceutical terminology (drug names, disease names, procedure codes, company-specific acronyms) to the model's recognition dictionary with appropriate phonetic representations and prior probabilities. This low-cost intervention (typically 1-2 days of ML engineering work) provides significant gains for novel or proprietary compound names not in the pre-training data.\nFine-tuning\nretrains portions of the neural network on Lilly-specific audio data, such as recordings of investigator meetings, quality review meetings, or sales call transcripts. Full fine-tuning updates all model parameters and requires substantial labeled data (10,000+ hours), while parameter-efficient methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) modify only small adapter modules inserted into the base model, achieving 80-90% of full fine-tuning benefits with 100x less training data.\nThe training data quality and diversity directly determines model robustness across Lilly's global operations. Models trained predominantly on North American English struggle with British, Indian, or Australian accents common in multinational clinical trials and research centers. Acoustic diversity matters equally: training datasets skewed toward quiet studio recordings generalize poorly to noisy manufacturing floors, hospital patient rooms, or outdoor clinical sites. The highest-performing pharmaceutical implementations deliberately include training data representing the actual deployment environments: recordings from manufacturing facilities with\nbackground machinery noise, clinical consultations with typical hospital ambient sounds, field-based researchers using smartphones in suboptimal acoustic conditions. This explains why general-purpose speech models require pharmaceutical-specific adaptation despite their strong baseline performance.\nVoice biomarker extraction and analysis\n​\nBeyond transcribing words, speech AI extracts quantitative features from voice acoustics that correlate with health status, emotional state, and cognitive function - capabilities with profound implications for clinical trials and patient monitoring. Voice biomarker analysis operates on both linguistic content (what is said) and paralinguistic acoustics (how it is said). Linguistic features include semantic coherence, lexical diversity, word-finding difficulty, grammatical complexity, and pause-to-word ratios. Paralinguistic features comprise fundamental frequency (pitch), jitter (pitch variability), shimmer (amplitude variability), formant frequencies (vocal tract resonances), mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (spectral envelope), zero-crossing rate (breathiness), and speech rate.\nMachine learning classifiers trained on clinically validated datasets learn to recognize patterns discriminating between healthy individuals and patients with specific conditions. For Parkinson's disease, characteristic features include reduced pitch variability (monotone speech), slower articulation rate, imprecise consonant production, and vocal tremor. Trained models analyzing 30-60 second speech samples achieve 85-95% sensitivity and specificity for Parkinson's detection, with accuracy improving when combining multiple speech tasks: sustained vowel phonation, rapid syllable repetition (pa-ta-ka), reading standardized passages, spontaneous speech describing a picture. The Framingham Heart Study analysis published in Nature (2024) demonstrated that speech content features predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease with 80% accuracy six years in advance, by detecting subtle declines in semantic richness and narrative coherence.\nDepression and anxiety detection relies heavily on prosodic features and temporal dynamics. Depressed individuals exhibit slower speech rate, longer pauses, reduced pitch variation (flatter affect), lower speech energy, and less pitch/amplitude modulation. Sonde Health's Mental Fitness Vocal Biomarker achieved relative risk ratios of 2.00 for detecting anxiety using aggregated two-week voice data in a prospective psychiatric cohort study, improving to 8.50 relative risk for frequent users providing 5-6 samples weekly. The technology enables continuous passive monitoring of mental health status from routine phone conversations or voice journaling, providing early warning signals of decompensation for intervention before crisis points. Respiratory conditions like COPD and COVID-19 alter voice quality through mechanisms including reduced airflow (breathiness), mucus accumulation (vocal tract damping), and inflammation (hoarseness), detectable with 70-80% accuracy from 6-second \"ahh\" vocalizations.\nImplementing voice biomarkers in pharmaceutical clinical trials requires rigorous analytical validation following FDA Biomarker Qualification Program standards. The qualification process involves demonstrating: (1) analytical validity (the biomarker reliably and accurately measures what it purports to measure), (2) clinical validity (the biomarker consistently and accurately predicts or correlates with the clinical outcome), and (3) clinical utility (the biomarker meaningfully informs clinical decision-making to improve patient outcomes). For voice biomarkers specifically, this necessitates large diverse datasets (thousands of participants across demographics, languages, and disease severities), longitudinal validation demonstrating stability of the biomarker in healthy individuals and predictable change patterns in disease progression, and prospective studies showing the biomarker improves upon existing endpoints. The Bridge2AI-Voice consortium's 10,000-participant, 50-institution initiative represents the first large-scale effort to establish the standardized protocols, reference datasets, and analytical pipelines required for regulatory qualification.\nIntegration with multimodal AI systems\n​\nThe most powerful pharmaceutical applications combine voice AI with complementary data modalities in unified machine learning frameworks.\nVoice plus computer vision\nenables ambient documentation in clinical settings: cameras track physician gaze, gestures, and activities (patient examination, screen viewing, writing) while microphones capture the clinical dialogue, with integrated AI models generating complete clinical notes including both observed physical exam findings and patient history. Johnson & Johnson's Polyphonic surgical video analysis system (partnership with NVIDIA, 2024) combines audio from the operating room with video of surgical techniques to generate highlight reels and identify best practices, reducing surgical training time by 50%.\nVoice plus wearable sensors\nenhances remote patient monitoring by correlating voice biomarkers with physiological signals. A clinical trial participant with Parkinson's disease provides daily 60-second speech samples via smartphone while continuously wearing an accelerometer-equipped smartwatch tracking tremor and gait. Machine learning models trained on the combined dataset achieve higher disease progression detection accuracy than either modality alone, learning that specific combinations of voice stability metrics and movement disorder features predict medication efficacy. The 5G network infrastructure and edge computing capabilities emerging in 2025 enable real-time processing of these multimodal data streams with latency under 500 milliseconds, supporting adaptive interventions.\nVoice plus knowledge graphs\npowers intelligent pharmaceutical information systems. A medical science liaison verbally queries \"What are the latest efficacy data for compound 247 in the Phase 3 ATLAS trial?\" The speech recognition system transcribes the question, a large language model interprets the intent and extracts entities (compound name, trial identifier, data type), the knowledge graph traverses relationships connecting the compound to clinical trials to efficacy endpoints to recent data updates, and the text-to-speech system verbalizes a comprehensive answer with appropriate scientific caveats. Microsoft's integration of Azure Speech Services with Azure OpenAI enables these sophisticated question-answering workflows with conversational natural language interfaces, transforming static document repositories into interactive AI assistants accessible by voice.\nMarket analysis: vendors, costs, and value proposition\n​\nThe AI speech technology market serving pharmaceutical operations exhibits rapid growth, vendor consolidation, and price-performance improvements creating favorable conditions for enterprise adoption. Global conversational AI in healthcare will expand from $13.68 billion in 2024 to $106.67 billion by 2033 at 25.71% compound annual growth rate, with speech recognition and voice generation representing approximately 30-35% of this total. For pharmaceutical-specific applications, voice biomarker markets project growth from $1.08 billion (2024) to $5.40 billion (2035) at 15.81% CAGR, while ambient clinical intelligence - a key use case for medical affairs and clinical operations - will reach $600 million in 2025, growing 2.4x year-over-year.\nCloud Platform Providers\n​\nMicrosoft Azure Speech Services\noffers the most comprehensive pharmaceutical ecosystem through its 2022 acquisition of Nuance Healthcare for $19.7 billion, combining cloud infrastructure with proven healthcare products. Dragon Medical One serves 550,000+ physicians and operates in 77% of U.S. hospitals, providing the deepest integration with Epic, Cerner, and Meditech electronic health records. For pharmaceutical applications, Azure provides Speech-to-Text in 92+ languages at $1.00 per hour of audio processed for standard models, with custom pharmaceutical vocabulary adaptation available. Neural Text-to-Speech costs $15.00 per million characters, generating natural-sounding patient communications and training content in 215 voices across 60 languages. Enterprise contracts could include HIPAA Business Associate Agreements, GDPR-compliant data processing, and commitment tier discounts for predictable workloads (volume discounts of 20-40% for million-hour annual commitments).\nThe strategic value for Lilly extends beyond speech APIs to complete ambient intelligence solutions. For example, Nuance DAX Copilot integrates GPT-4 with ambient listening to generate clinical documentation from physician-patient conversations within minutes, priced at approximately $600 monthly per provider under enterprise agreements. Independent validation shows 70% reduction in clinician burnout and 50% reduction in documentation time. The Permanente Medical Group reported 15,791 hours saved annually (equivalent to 8 full-time employees) using Nuance ambient intelligence. For Lilly, this translates to medical science liaison documentation automation, clinical trial investigator meeting transcription, and medical monitor note generation with pharmaceutical-grade compliance and audit trails.\nGoogle Cloud Speech-to-Text\nemphasizes accuracy for medical conversations through its Chirp 3 foundation model trained on billions of sentences. Medical conversation models optimized for clinical dialogues cost $0.072 per minute ($4.32 per hour), representing a 4x premium over standard models but delivering superior accuracy on pharmaceutical terminology, drug names, and adverse event descriptions. Google's Healthcare Natural Language API complements speech recognition with entity extraction identifying medications, dosages, symptoms, and diagnoses from transcribed text, enabling structured data capture from unstructured clinical narratives. The platform supports 125+ languages with single-region or multi-region deployment options addressing data sovereignty requirements across Lilly's global operations. Performance benchmarks show Google's medical models achieve 15-20% lower Word Error Rates than generic speech recognition on pharmacology content.\nAmazon Web Services\npositions Transcribe Medical specifically for healthcare use cases at $0.0237 per minute for batch processing and $0.0395 per minute for real-time streaming, including HIPAA-eligible infrastructure with Business Associate Agreements. The service automatically recognizes medical terminology across 31 specialties including oncology, cardiology, and neurology - the therapeutic areas most relevant to Lilly's portfolio. Amazon Polly neural voices generate text-to-speech at $16 per million characters for neural quality, suitable for patient education materials and multilingual clinical trial communications. The compelling value proposition for pharmaceutical companies emerges from tight integration with AWS's broader healthcare data analytics stack: speech data flows into Amazon HealthLake for FHIR-based clinical data warehouses, with Amazon Comprehend Medical extracting structured clinical concepts for downstream analysis.\nCost modeling for enterprise speech AI adoption depends on anticipated monthly volume and use case distribution. AI speech processings ($1-2.5/hour) compares very favorably to human transcription services ($1.50-3.00 per audio minute).\nSpecialized pharmaceutical and healthcare vendors\n​\nNuance Healthcare\n(Microsoft-owned) dominates ambient clinical intelligence with market-leading products purpose-built for healthcare documentation. Dragon Medical One provides continuous speech recognition for clinical note dictation at custom enterprise pricing. DAX Copilot represents the premium tier provider, offering fully automated visit note generation from ambient conversation capture without requiring specific voice commands or structured dictation. The April 2023 launch of DAX Express provides completely automated workflow with no human review in the transcription loop, though human physician review of the final note remains mandatory for medical-legal reasons. Nuance reports that 300 million patient stories are captured annually through its platform, with 77% of U.S. hospitals using Nuance technology in some capacity.\nFor Lilly medical affairs applications, integration with Veeva CRM could enable medical science liaisons to focus entirely on medical dialogue with healthcare providers while the ambient system automatically generates compliant interaction documentation including medical information exchanged, physician questions, and product discussions. Assuming a 50-70% documentation time reduction directly translates to increased field capacity: a 50-representative MSL team saving 10 hours per week each gains 500 hours of additional physician engagement time weekly, enabling 50-100 additional meaningful medical interactions monthly depending on meeting duration.\nSuki AI\ntargets the mid-market sweet spot with comprehensive ambient documentation, achieving 93.2 KLAS overall performance score and serving 250+ U.S. health systems across 99 medical specialties. The platform provides end-to-end AI assistance including pre-charting (automatically pulling relevant historical information before visits), ambient note-taking during consultations, clinical reasoning support, ICD-10/CPT coding recommendations, and question-answering from medical literature. Deep EHR integrations with Epic, Cerner, Athenahealth, and MEDITECH enable bidirectional data flow, automatically pulling context from the EHR and writing structured notes back to appropriate fields. Suki reports 72% reduction in documentation time, 6 hours reduction in after-hours \"pajama time\" documentation, and 9x first-year ROI.\nFor Lilly clinical operations, this technology could apply to clinical trial site support, medical monitor documentation, and investigator meeting transcription.\nAbridge\ncommands 30% market share in ambient clinical intelligence (second only to Nuance's 33%) with strong Epic integration and adoption by Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, and UPMC health systems. The platform uniquely captures structured patient instructions and next steps, automatically generating after-visit summaries in patient-friendly language that can be immediately shared, improving patient engagement and protocol adherence - a critical feature for clinical trial applications where participant understanding drives retention and compliance. The 90-day audio retention policy (shorter than Nuance's indefinite retention with patient consent) may limit usefulness for long-term clinical research applications requiring extended review periods or regulatory audits spanning years.\nVoice biomarker companies for clinical endpoints\n​\nWinterlight Labs\nleads cognitive assessment through speech analysis, with active deployment in 12+ clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease, depression, dementia, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The technology analyzes 30-40 second speech samples using natural language processing to quantify semantic coherence, lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, and acoustic features. Cambridge Cognition acquired Winterlight in January 2023 for approximately $8.6 million, integrating speech biomarkers with their established cognitive testing battery. The combined offering provides pharmaceutical sponsors a validated digital endpoint package: traditional computerized cognitive assessments plus voice biomarkers, enabling comprehensive cognitive function monitoring in Alzheimer's and dementia trials with reduced participant burden compared to lengthy in-person cognitive batteries.\nFor Lilly's neuroscience portfolio, voice biomarkers may offer several strategic advantages over conventional cognitive endpoints.\nContinuous remote monitoring\ncaptures daily or weekly measurements reflecting real-world cognitive fluctuations, rather than snapshot assessments at quarterly clinic visits that miss disease dynamics and treatment response variability.\nReduced participant burden\n(30-60 seconds voice recording versus 45-60 minute cognitive test batteries) improves retention in elderly populations and those with significant impairment who struggle with long assessments.\nIncreased sensitivity\nto subtle changes may detect treatment effects earlier or with smaller sample sizes, potentially reducing Phase 2 trial costs by 20-30% through better go/no-go decision-making.\nEcological validity\nof speech production - a complex real-world task integrating memory, executive function, language, and motor control - arguably better represents functional capacity than abstract computerized tests.\nSonde Health\nspecializes in mental health and respiratory voice biomarkers, with FDA regulatory pathway engagement positioning their Mental Fitness Vocal Biomarker and Respiratory-Responsive Vocal Biomarker for clinical decision support. The MFVB demonstrated in a 104-participant prospective psychiatric cohort that aggregated two-week voice data achieved relative risk ratio of 2.00 for detecting anxiety (p=0.0068), improving to 8.50 for users providing 5-6 samples weekly. The RRVB trained on 3,000+ respiratory disease patients achieved 70% sensitivity and specificity across asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and persistent cough, with validation extended to COVID-19 detection (73.2% sensitivity, 62.9% specificity for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases). Strategic partnerships with Qualcomm enable on-device processing on mobile chipsets, addressing privacy concerns by keeping voice data local rather than transmitting to cloud servers.\nFor Lilly's immunology brands, respiratory voice biomarkers may enable real-world evidence generation showing treatment impact on day-to-day breathing function beyond controlled spirometry at clinic visits. Depression and anxiety voice monitoring supports neuropsychiatry trials and post-market surveillance for CNS compounds where psychiatric adverse events require vigilant monitoring. Commercial deployment could differentiate patient support programs: branded smartphone apps with daily voice check-ins providing patients continuous feedback on symptom trends and automatically alerting care teams to concerning changes.\nCanary Speech\nemerged from former Amazon Alexa neurology and speech AI teams, offering the industry's most comprehensive multi-condition platform extracting 12+ million biomarkers per minute of speech. FDA registration (not full approval) provides credibility for healthcare system adoption. The technology addresses Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, depression, anxiety, stress assessment, and readmission risk prediction. The proactive screening capability - identifying individuals at risk before symptoms emerge aligns with pharmaceutical industry interest in earlier diagnosis enabling intervention in milder disease stages where disease-modifying therapies have best chance of success.\nFor Lilly, this suggests potential partnerships embedding Canary Speech screening in primary care workflows to identify patients who might benefit from neuroscience therapies, expanding the addressable patient population.\nThe compelling economics emerge in Phase 2/3 trials where voice biomarkers could serve as secondary or exploratory endpoints. A 200-participant Phase 2 trial adding voice biomarkers at $100 per participant represents a fractional cost of total trial cost while potentially providing crucial supportive evidence of mechanism, guiding dose selection, or enabling patient stratification. If voice biomarker data enables better Phase 3 trial design, reducing the required sample size by even 50 patients, the savings far exceed the voice biomarker investment.\nHigh-level Value Indicators\n​\nQuantitative ROI analysis across implemented pharmaceutical use cases reveals consistently strong business cases with payback periods of 3-18 months and multi-year returns of 200-1,200%. The most immediate value derives from productivity improvements in high-cost knowledge worker roles where voice AI eliminates low-value documentation tasks, reallocating human capital to higher-value activities.\nMedical Affairs\n: MSLs may spend 35% of time on administrative tasks (call notes, follow-up emails, CRM data entry, expense reports) = ~35 hours per week per MSL\nClinical Operations\n: 10-minute average handling time, most requiring transcription for pharmacovigilance and regulatory documentation\nLRL lab productivity\n: Research scientists may be spending 2 hours a day on documentation and data entry\nData quality improvements\n: Eliminating manual transcription errors reduces protocol deviations (clinical trials), batch failures (manufacturing), and data-cleaning overhead (R&D). Industry estimates suggest 2-5% of clinical trial costs relate to data issues that voice AI reduces by 30-50%.\nRegulatory compliance\n: Complete audit trails, elimination of paper records, improved GMP documentation quality reduce FDA 483 observations and warning letter risk. The business impact of avoided regulatory citations (production delays, consent decree costs, reputational harm) can exceed millions but proves difficult to quantify prospectively.\nEmployee satisfaction and retention\n: Nuance reports 70-94% of physicians report reduced burnout with ambient AI. For pharmaceutical roles with high turnover costs (recruiting, training, productivity ramp), even modest retention improvements generate substantial value. Replacing knowledge workers come at a high cost (months for recruiting, onboarding, training to full productivity).\nUse Case Examples\n​\nResearch and Discovery\n​\nVoice-enabled laboratory informatics systems transform research productivity by eliminating the friction between conducting experiments and capturing data. Traditional laboratory workflows interrupt experimental procedures for researchers to remove gloves, type observations into computers, and then 're-glove' - a cycle repeated dozens of times daily that consumes 15-25% of active research time. LabTwin's AI-powered mobile voice assistant provides hands-free data capture allowing scientists to verbally dictate experimental observations, request protocol steps, log sample information, and query previous results while maintaining sterile technique and workflow continuity. Implementation at dsm-firmenich achieved 100% real-time digitization of lab data with 16% increase in data capture rate, attributed to recording observations immediately rather than deferring to end-of-day batch entry where details fade and errors accumulate.\nThe integration architecture connects voice AI with Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN) through bidirectional APIs. When a researcher verbally reports \"sample concentration 247 micromolar,\" the voice system transcribes the utterance, applies natural language understanding to extract structured data (sample identifier from context, concentration value 247, units micromolar), validates against expected ranges for the assay, and automatically populates the corresponding LIMS field with full audit trail (timestamp, user, voice confidence score). Researchers query existing data conversationally: \"What was the IC50 for compound 181 in the kinase assay?\" The system retrieves relevant records and verbalizes the answer, eliminating time searching through databases or spreadsheets.\nLabVantage LOTTIE (LabVantage Open Talk Interactive Experience), as an example, exemplifies purpose-built LIMS voice integration, with customizable voice commands executing complex workflows. A chromatography technician verbally triggers \"begin sample prep protocol for batch 445\" and the system retrieves the SOP, displays the current step, marks the protocol as in-progress, reserves necessary equipment, and logs the initiation time - actions requiring 8-10 manual clicks compressed into a 3-second voice command. The property-driven configuration language enables lab managers to define facility-specific commands without programming: \"check freezer 7 temperature\" could query IoT sensors and verbalize the current reading, while \"reserve mass spec for Tuesday at 2pm\" enters equipment scheduling systems.\nBeyond convenience, voice interfaces enable novel experimental approaches. Researchers conducting extended observations (cell culture monitoring, crystallization kinetics, reaction progression) can provide continuous verbal running commentary captured as timestamped annotations correlated with automated sensor data (microscope images, spectroscopy readings, temperature profiles). Machine learning algorithms later analyze synchronized multi-modal data streams to identify subtle patterns human observers miss. In chemical synthesis, verbal description of reaction color changes, precipitate formation, or odor characteristics (safety permitting) captures qualitative information that numerical sensors cannot, providing complete experimental records valuable for troubleshooting and knowledge transfer.\nThe accessibility benefits significantly impact researchers with disabilities or repetitive strain injuries. Voice interaction eliminates barriers for scientists with limited hand mobility, visual impairments interfacing with screen readers, or carpal tunnel syndrome aggravated by extensive typing. This aligns with Lilly's diversity and inclusion objectives while tapping talent that might otherwise face challenges in laboratory roles.\nClinical Development\n​\nClinical trials represent the most transformative application domain for pharmaceutical voice AI, with implications spanning patient recruitment, continuous monitoring, digital endpoints, adverse event capture, and protocol adherence. The convergence of validated voice biomarkers, regulatory acceptance of digital health technologies, and decentralized trial models creates ideal conditions for large-scale deployment in Lilly's clinical programs.\nVoice biomarkers as clinical trial endpoints\naddress limitations of conventional assessment scales that provide sparse infrequent measurements subject to recall bias, practice effects, and limited ecological validity. Consider a Phase 2 trial for a novel Alzheimer's therapy using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) as primary endpoint, measured at baseline and then quarterly clinic visits (months 3, 6, 9, 12). This design provides only 5 data points per participant across a year, missing disease variability between visits and potential treatment effects that emerge then plateau between measurements. Voice biomarkers captured weekly through smartphone apps provide 52 data points per participant, revealing treatment response trajectories, durability of effect, and individual variability patterns invisible in sparse quarterly assessments.\nThe Voice as Biomarker project (NIH-funded, Weill Cornell/University of South Florida) released 12,500 voice recordings from 306 cognitively diverse participants in December 2024, representing the first large-scale standardized voice biomarker dataset. The protocol includes 20 voice tasks: reading passages, free speech describing pictures, counting, breathing exercises, and coughing. Analysis demonstrates that specific linguistic features (semantic coherence, pause patterns, word-finding latency) predict progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia with 80% accuracy 6 years prospectively, based on Boston University's Framingham Heart Study cohort analysis published in Nature (2024). These results suggest voice biomarkers could serve as prognostic enrichment criteria (enrolling trial participants more likely to progress, increasing power to detect treatment effects) or as surrogate endpoints (early evidence of disease modification before clinical symptoms change).\nFor Lilly's\nneuroscience\npipeline, voice biomarkers may offer immediate application in Parkinson's disease trials.\nMotor function assessment via speech analysis\ncomplements the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) which requires in-person clinician administration. Smartphone-based speech tasks (sustained vowel \"ahh\" for 10 seconds, rapid syllable repetition \"pa-ta-ka\", reading a standardized paragraph) capture voice quality, pitch stability, articulatory precision, and speech rate - features correlating with MDS-UPDRS motor scores (correlation coefficients 0.6-0.75) and demonstrating sensitivity to dopaminergic medication effects. A 150-participant Phase 2 trial collecting voice biomarkers 3x weekly provides 150 participants x 3 samples/week x 48 weeks = 21,600 data points, versus 750 data points from quarterly MDS-UPDRS assessments. The increased measurement density improves statistical power, potentially reducing required sample size by 20-30% (saving $3-5M in trial costs) while providing richer dataset for dose selection and patient stratification.\nMental health applications parallel neurology. Sonde Health's validation study demonstrating relative risk ratio of 2.00 for anxiety detection from aggregated two-week voice data (p=0.0068) suggests utility for safety monitoring in psychiatric trials or CNS compounds where anxiety represents a potential adverse effect. Daily voice check-ins administered through patient-facing trial apps capture mental health status continuously, providing objective data complementing subjective patient-reported outcomes. The\nTherabot trial\npublished in NEJM AI (March 2025) demonstrated that generative AI conversational agents achieved 51% average depression symptom reduction with engagement levels (6 hours over 8 weeks) comparable to traditional therapy. While Therabot serves therapeutic purposes, the underlying voice analysis capability enables passive monitoring during those interactions, creating data streams for clinical research.\nAdverse event capture from natural language\nrepresents an immediate near-term application requiring less regulatory validation than formal endpoints. Medical information contact centers receiving unsolicited AE reports currently rely on human transcription and coding, consuming 10-15 minutes per call and introducing 24-48 hour delays before pharmacovigilance database entry. ProPharma Medical Information Contact Center reports that AI-powered speech recognition with automated AE identification achieves 40% reduction in case intake processing time, accelerating safety signal detection and regulatory reporting compliance. Natural language processing algorithms trained on pharmacovigilance taxonomy automatically identify verbatim terms (patient-reported symptom descriptions), map to preferred terms (MedDRA coding), and extract metadata (onset date, severity, relationship to study drug, concomitant medications). The system flags serious adverse events (death, hospitalization, life-threatening events) for immediate escalation to medical monitors.\nImplementation architecture for clinical trial voice biomarkers requires consideration of data flow, regulatory compliance, and participant experience. Example implementation pattern:\nPatient-facing mobile app (iOS/Android) administering standardized voice tasks with prompts and instructions, recording high-quality audio locally\nOn-device initial processing using privacy-preserving algorithms extracting voice features without transmitting raw audio (addressing patient privacy concerns)\nEncrypted transmission of derived features (numerical vectors, not audio) to clinical trial data management systems via HTTPS with certificate pinning\nCloud-based advanced analytics in HIPAA/GDPR-compliant infrastructure (AWS/Azure healthcare zones) performing machine learning inference\neCRF integration - writing voice biomarker scores to electronic case report forms as study data\nAudit trail generation - documenting complete data provenance for regulatory inspection\nThe sponsor retains original audio recordings in encrypted archival storage for potential regulatory queries but primarily operates on privacy-preserving features, reducing re-identification risk and simplifying data protection compliance.\nManufacturing and Quality\n​\nPharmaceutical manufacturing operates under stringent Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations requiring complete documentation of every production step, environmental condition, material transfer, and quality check. The traditional paradigm demands operators interrupt hands-on work to manually record data on paper batch records or log into manufacturing execution systems (MES), creating productivity bottlenecks and introducing transcription errors. Voice-enabled manufacturing systems allow hands-free documentation while maintaining continuous production flow, improving both efficiency and data quality.\nThe\n21 CFR Part 11 compliance\nframework for electronic records and signatures applies equally to voice-captured data, requiring systems that ensure authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. Implementation involves: (1) speaker authentication through voice biometrics or secondary credentials (badge scan, PIN), (2) secure timestamping of all voice interactions with NTP-synchronized clocks, (3) audit trail generation recording user identity, timestamp, original voice data, transcribed text, system actions, and approval chains, (4) version control for voice-enabled SOPs and work instructions, (5) electronic signature capture for critical process steps using voice passphrase plus secondary factor.\nQuality control testing\nexemplifies hands-free value proposition. A QC analyst performing pH measurement on 30 samples can verbally report \"sample one zero three pH 6.8\" for each measurement as performed, rather than recording on paper then transcribing to LIMS post-shift. The voice system integrates with laboratory equipment (pH meters, balances, spectrophotometers) via IoT protocols, cross-validating verbal reports against instrument readings. If the analyst reports \"pH 6.8\" but the connected pH meter indicates 6.9, the system flags the discrepancy for immediate resolution, preventing errors from entering permanent records.\nBatch record documentation\ntransforms from paper-intensive to voice-driven workflows. An operator conducting visual inspection of fill-finish vials verbally confirms \"one hundred units inspected, zero rejects, lot number A4739\" and the system automatically populates corresponding batch record fields, attaches electronic signature, marks the step complete, and advances to the next protocol step. For time-critical operations like aseptic processing where operators cannot break sterile field, voice interaction maintains continuous workflow while ensuring complete documentation. Research published in PMC (AI and IoT Integration in Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, 2024) demonstrates that CNN-based visual inspection integrated with voice verification achieves 99.86% accuracy in pharmaceutical quality control, combining AI image analysis with verbal operator confirmation for optimal human-AI collaboration.\nPredictive maintenance\ngains from voice-enabled reporting. When operators notice unusual equipment sounds, vibrations, or performance characteristics not captured by automated sensors (subtleties like slight binding in tablet press tooling or unusual smell from HVAC systems), they verbally report observations immediately through mobile devices or floor-mounted voice terminals. Machine learning algorithms aggregate verbal reports with IoT sensor data (vibration, temperature, current draw) to predict equipment failures before breakdowns occur. The same PMC study reports 30% reduction in unplanned manufacturing downtime through this voice-augmented predictive maintenance approach, directly impacting production throughput and product supply reliability.\nDeviation management\naccelerates through voice-enabled workflows. When operators identify deviations (parameters outside specifications, missed process steps, material discrepancies), immediate verbal reporting initiates the deviation process: the voice system generates a deviation record with preliminary details, notifies quality and production management, and prompts the operator through initial corrective actions. This reduces median deviation reporting time from 4-6 hours (completing paper forms, obtaining management signatures, scanning to quality systems) to 15-30 minutes, enabling faster root cause analysis and corrective action while memories remain fresh.\nValidation of voice-enabled manufacturing systems follows Computer System Validation (CSV) principles per GAMP 5 guidance, with voice AI systems typically classified as GAMP Category 4 (configured products) or Category 5 (custom applications). The validation lifecycle includes:\nInstallation Qualification (IQ)\n: Verifying voice hardware (microphones, network infrastructure) and software (speech recognition engines, MES integration modules) installed per specifications with appropriate security configurations, backup systems, and disaster recovery capabilities.\nOperational Qualification (OQ)\n: Functional testing covering voice recognition accuracy across user population (different voices, accents, speech patterns), environmental conditions (background noise typical of production areas, cleanroom HEPA filters, equipment operation), and failure modes (network interruption, API timeout, ambiguous utterances). Testing validates voice commands execute correct MES functions, data populates proper fields, errors trigger appropriate exception handling, and alternative input methods function when voice unavailable.\nPerformance Qualification (PQ)\n: Real-world validation during actual production runs demonstrates that voice-enabled documentation produces complete, accurate batch records meeting GMP requirements. Statistical analysis confirms voice transcription accuracy exceeds 95% with error rates below manual paper documentation. User acceptance testing with representative operators across shifts confirms usability and identifies workflow refinements.\nThe validation documentation package (Validation Master Plan, protocols, test scripts, test evidence, summary reports, traceability matrices) demonstrates to regulatory inspectors that voice-enabled systems consistently produce GMP-compliant documentation. Revalidation follows any significant changes: software version upgrades, MES integration modifications, or substantive SOP revisions.\nCommercial and Medical Affairs\n​\nMedical science liaisons represent pharmaceutical companies' most valuable customer-facing asset, with average fully-loaded costs of $250,000-300,000 annually per representative. The strategic imperative involves maximizing high-value medical dialogue time with healthcare providers while minimizing low-value administrative burden. Voice AI transforms MSL effectiveness through three primary mechanisms: automated interaction documentation, intelligent pre-call preparation, and real-time support during engagements.\nIQVIA Field Force Agent exemplifies comprehensive voice-enabled MSL support, integrating ambient intelligence with CRM systems and medical databases. The pre-call workflow begins with voice query: \"Brief me on Dr. Johnson ahead of my 2pm meeting.\" The AI assistant retrieves the physician's profile from IQVIA's OneKey database (25M+ HCPs, 6M+ HCOs across 118 countries), recent interactions from Veeva CRM, published research, clinical trial involvement, formulary position at their institution, and generates a voice summary highlighting key talking points and potential areas of interest. This 2-3 minute briefing replaces 15-20 minutes of manual research, producing the documented 27% reduction in call preparation time.\nDuring the medical engagement, ambient listening captures the conversation without requiring the MSL to take notes or interrupt dialogue flow. Post-meeting, AI generates structured documentation including: medical topics discussed, product information provided, healthcare provider questions and MSL responses, scientific literature exchanged, commitments for follow-up, next interaction recommendations. The system automatically populates Veeva CRM with required fields (contact date, interaction type, products discussed, attendees), generates follow-up email drafts with referenced scientific publications, and creates reminders for promised information delivery. The MSL reviews and approves the automated documentation (human-in-the-loop compliance requirement) before finalizing, reducing post-call documentation from 45 minutes to 5-10 minutes.\nZS Field Force Effectiveness@Scale, for example, adds AI coaching capabilities analyzing MSL conversation patterns against best practices. The system identifies when MSLs effectively address objections, probe for unmet medical needs, or position scientific evidence persuasively. Aggregated across hundreds of interactions, pattern recognition algorithms surface communication techniques correlating with positive HCP engagement outcomes, enabling data-driven coaching: \"MSLs who ask for HCP perspectives on emerging biomarker data before presenting clinical trial results achieve 35% higher follow-up meeting rates.\" This transforms anecdotal coaching into precision skill development.\nFor sales representatives in Lilly's commercial organization, voice technology might address unique compliance challenges. The highly regulated promotion environment requires documented evidence that sales messaging remains within FDA-approved labeling and promotional review board approvals. Voice-enabled CRM systems (integrating tools like Maggie Voice Bot deployed by 500+ pharmaceutical field representatives in India) capture sales call details through natural conversation: \"Visited Dr. Patel at Memorial Hospital, discussed indication in relapsed refractory setting, left dosing guide and patient brochure.\" The system validates the interaction complies with approved promotional claims, automatically generates call notes, tracks sample distribution, and identifies potential off-label promotion for compliance intervention.\nMedical information services examples\nleverage conversational AI to scale inquiry handling while maintaining medical accuracy. Pfizer's multi-country deployment demonstrates the maturity of this approach:\nMedibot (US): Answers temperature stability questions for biologics, critical for pharmacies managing complex storage requirements\nFabi (Brazil): Handles 6,000+ non-technical customer questions monthly, reducing call center volume and providing 24/7 availability\nMaibo (Japan): Delivers medical information to healthcare professionals with local language fluency and cultural appropriateness\nThe architecture employs knowledge graphs connecting products to indications, dosing, adverse events, drug interactions, and supportive scientific evidence. When inquiries arrive via phone, web chat, or voice assistants, NLP extracts intent and entities, the knowledge graph retrieves relevant information verified by medical affairs, and responses undergo safety checks before delivery (screening for potential adverse events or product quality complaints requiring pharmacovigilance reporting). Critical inquiries exceeding the AI's confidence threshold escalate to human medical information specialists, with the AI providing draft response and relevant background information to accelerate human handling.\nThe integration with pharmacovigilance systems represents a critical safety capability. Conversational AI analyzing medical information contacts automatically identifies potential adverse events through pattern matching on symptom descriptions, temporal relationships to product use, and severity indicators. When detected, the system immediately generates a safety case intake form with verbatim patient/provider statements, prompts the medical information specialist for additional required information, and routes to pharmacovigilance for regulatory reporting. ProPharma reports this automation achieves 40% reduction in safety case processing time, directly supporting Lilly's patient safety obligations and regulatory compliance.\nRegulatory Compliance\n​\nThe regulatory landscape for pharmaceutical AI speech technologies crystallized in 2025 with FDA's draft guidance on AI in drug submissions and EMA's final reflection paper, creating clear pathways for implementation while maintaining stringent data protection and validation requirements.\nVoice data's classification as both Protected Health Information (PHI) under HIPAA and special category biometric data under GDPR Article 9 necessitates comprehensive privacy-by-design architecture with explicit consent mechanisms, data minimization, and sovereignty controls across Lilly's US, EU, and Asia-Pacific operations.\nFDA Framework and Validation Requirements\n​\nThe FDA's January 2025 draft guidance \"Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making\" establishes risk-based credibility assessment criteria for AI systems in drug development.\nVoice AI applications fall into three FDA risk categories:\n(1) Low-risk administrative uses like transcription of non-critical meetings, requiring basic validation; (2) Moderate-risk clinical documentation and adverse event detection, necessitating comprehensive Computer System Validation per 21 CFR Part 11; (3) High-risk clinical trial endpoints using voice biomarkers, demanding full analytical and clinical validation through the Biomarker Qualification Program.\nThe FDA explicitly requires \"fit-for-purpose\" validation demonstrating the AI system reliably performs its intended function within specified contexts. For voice biomarkers as clinical endpoints, this involves establishing analytical validity (consistent measurement across devices, environments, populations), clinical validity (correlation with established clinical outcomes), and clinical utility (improved patient outcomes or trial efficiency). The agency emphasizes continuous monitoring post-deployment, with documented procedures for model drift detection, retraining triggers, and version control maintaining regulatory compliance as AI systems evolve.\nEMA Guidance and EU Implementation\n​\nEMA's September 2024 final \"Reflection Paper on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Medicinal Product Lifecycle\" aligns with FDA principles while adding European-specific requirements. The guidance mandates transparency in AI decision-making processes, with pharmaceutical companies required to document model architecture, training data characteristics, performance metrics, and known limitations. For voice AI processing EU citizen data, GDPR Article 22 grants individuals the right not to be subject to solely automated decision-making, requiring human review loops for any voice-based assessments affecting trial participation or treatment decisions.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) classification of certain voice biomarker software as Class IIa medical devices (active devices for diagnosis/monitoring) triggers CE marking requirements including technical documentation, clinical evaluation, and notified body assessment. This particularly impacts standalone voice assessment apps used in decentralized clinical trials, requiring Lilly to determine whether voice tools constitute investigational medical devices subject to MDR oversight beyond pharmaceutical regulatory frameworks.\nHIPAA and Data Protection Requirements\n​\nVoice recordings containing patient health discussions or collected during clinical care constitute Protected Health Information under HIPAA, requiring Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with all technology vendors processing voice data. The minimum necessary standard applies: voice AI systems should access only the audio segments required for their specific function, with automatic redaction of incidental PHI captured in recordings. De-identification following Safe Harbor or Expert Determination methods enables broader research use, though voice characteristics themselves may enable re-identification, limiting true anonymization potential.\nHIPAA Security Rule safeguards for voice data mandate: (1) Access controls with unique user identification and automatic logoff from voice interfaces; (2) Encryption of voice data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3+); (3) Audit logs capturing all voice data access, modification, and transmission; (4) Integrity controls ensuring voice recordings and transcriptions remain unaltered post-capture; (5) Transmission security for voice data crossing network boundaries, particularly relevant for cloud-based speech processing.\nGDPR Article 9 and Biometric Data Governance\n​\nVoice recordings constitute special category biometric data under GDPR Article 9 when used for unique identification or health assessment, triggering enhanced protection requirements. Processing requires explicit consent with clear disclosure of: specific purposes (research, clinical assessment, safety monitoring), data retention periods (typically 10 years for clinical trial data), third-party sharing (CROs, technology vendors, regulatory authorities), cross-border transfers (particularly US processing of EU voice data), and individual rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability).\nThe consent withdrawal right creates operational complexity: participants must be able to revoke consent for future voice processing while potentially maintaining already-collected data for scientific integrity. Lilly must implement granular consent management distinguishing primary trial purposes (where withdrawal may require study discontinuation) from secondary research uses (where selective withdrawal preserves trial participation). Data minimization principles favor on-device voice processing extracting only necessary features rather than transmitting full audio to centralized servers, reducing privacy risk and simplifying compliance.\nCross-Border Data Transfer Mechanisms\n​\nProcessing voice data across Lilly's global operations requires lawful transfer mechanisms addressing Schrems II decision invalidating Privacy Shield. Options include: (1) Standard Contractual Clauses with supplementary measures (encryption, pseudonymization, access controls) demonstrating US government surveillance laws cannot compromise EU voice data protection; (2) Binding Corporate Rules for intra-Lilly transfers, though these require extensive regulatory approval; (3) Explicit consent for transfers, viable for clinical trial participants but insufficient as sole basis for employee voice data; (4) Data localization with region-specific processing infrastructure, increasing cost but simplifying compliance.\nAsia-Pacific Regional Variations\n​\nChina's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) mirrors GDPR principles with stricter localization requirements: voice data from Chinese citizens must be stored within China with government security assessments for any cross-border transfer. Japan's Act on Protection of Personal Information (APPI) requires purpose limitation and consent for voice processing but provides GDPR adequacy, simplifying EU-Japan data flows. Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act permits broader commercial use with opt-out consent for non-sensitive applications, though health-related voice analysis likely requires explicit consent comparable to Western standards.\nWas this helpful?\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nAI Avatars / Digital People\nNext\nAI Video Generation\nExecutive Summary\nWhat is AI speech technology\nHow AI speech technology works\nSignal processing and acoustic feature extraction\nTransformer architectures for speech recognition\nNeural text-to-speech synthesis\nDirect speech-to-speech models deliver speed but sacrifice pharmaceutical safety requirements\nPipeline architectures achieve medical-grade accuracy through specialized components and modular optimization\nHybrid approaches combining strengths remain largely theoretical for pharmaceutical applications\nThe Accuracy-Latency Tradeoff\nRecent S2S Developments\nTraining methods and transfer learning\nVoice biomarker extraction and analysis\nIntegration with multimodal AI systems\nMarket analysis: vendors, costs, and value proposition\nCloud Platform Providers\nSpecialized pharmaceutical and healthcare vendors\nVoice biomarker companies for clinical endpoints\nHigh-level Value Indicators\nUse Case Examples\nResearch and Discovery\nClinical Development\nManufacturing and Quality\nCommercial and Medical Affairs\nRegulatory Compliance\nFDA Framework and Validation Requirements\nEMA Guidance and EU Implementation\nHIPAA and Data Protection Requirements\nGDPR Article 9 and Biometric Data Governance\nCross-Border Data Transfer Mechanisms\nAsia-Pacific Regional Variations\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

Recent breakthroughs in generative AI models – especially\ndiffusion and transformer-based models – have dramatically improved the realism and coherence of AI-generated video\nclips. Today’s leading AI video tools can produce short high-definition videos (typically a few seconds up to ~20\nseconds) with cinematic visuals, diverse styles, and even synchronized audio. Major AI providers\nlike OpenAI, Google, Adobe, and a wave of startups are rapidly advancing this field. For tech and business leaders, AI\nvideo generation promises significant opportunities: dramatically lowering the cost and time required to produce\nmarketing videos, training content, or promotional media; enabling mass personalization of video messages; and unlocking\ncreative concepts that would be impractical with traditional filming. Early adopters in marketing (including pharma\ncommercial teams) are already experimenting with AI-generated b-roll footage, product visualizations, and even\nAI-generated spokespeople. At the same time, this technology raises new challenges and risks – from output quality\nlimitations (e.g. surreal physics or inconsistent characters) to ethical concerns like deepfakes and brand safety. The\ncurrent state-of-the-art models still struggle with longer narrative coherence and some realism aspects, but progress is\nrapid. Competitors in the US and China are pushing the boundaries: for example, OpenAI’s Sora model can generate up to\n20-second 1080p videos with rich detail, while Google’s newly unveiled Veo 3 model goes further by integrating\naudio (music, sound effects, even speech) directly into generated videos. Well-funded startups like Pika Labs and\nindustry players like Adobe (with Firefly) are adding features such as storyboarding tools, keyframe control, and direct\nintegration into creative workflows. Lilly should pay close attention to this fast-evolving landscape – the companies,\nmodels, and capabilities discussed in this report – to craft strategies for adoption. In the near term, AI video\ngenerators can augment creative teams, accelerate content production, and enable novel marketing strategies, if\norganizations also institute proper oversight (to manage legal, ethical, and quality concerns). This report provides a\ndeep dive into the technology, key players (and their relative strengths/weaknesses), feature comparisons, industry use\ncases (with a focus on marketing, training, and pharma applications), and recommendations for strategic adoption of AI\nvideo generation.\nIntroduction\n​\nThe ability for AI to generate video content on demand – once a futuristic concept – is now becoming reality. Over the\npast few years, generative AI has progressed from creating still images to producing short video clips. In 2022-2023,\nearly text-to-video research prototypes (e.g. Meta’s Make-A-Video) showed the potential but were limited to a few\nseconds of low-resolution, often jittery footage. Fast-forward to 2024-2025, and we see the emergence of commercial AI\nvideo generation tools that anyone can try. These systems take a prompt (text description and optionally reference\nimages or video clips) and synthesize a new video clip matching the description. Under the hood, most utilize diffusion\nmodels or advanced transformers that have been trained on vast amounts of video data to learn how to generate\nconsecutive frames coherently. Essentially, they extend the techniques that made AI image generators (like DALL·E and\nStable Diffusion) so successful, adding a temporal dimension to handle motion and physics.\nThis technology arrives at an apt time: organizations are hungry for more video content than ever (for social media,\ne-learning, personalized marketing), but traditional video production is time-consuming and costly. AI video generation\npromises to democratize video creation, making it almost as easy as writing a script. A marketer could simply “tell” an\nAI, “Show a medicine droplet traveling through a bloodstream and destroying viruses, in a cinematic style,” and get a\ncustom animated clip within minutes – something that would have taken a VFX studio weeks to produce. Likewise, a\ntraining team could generate scenario videos with different backgrounds or actors at the click of a button. The\nimplications span many industries: media and entertainment (AI-assisted filmmaking and pre-visualization), advertising\n(rapid content iteration and localization), education (illustrative videos), and more. In pharma marketing specifically,\nwe envision uses like mechanism-of-action animations, doctor-patient roleplay scenarios for training, or personalized\npatient education videos generated for different demographics and languages.\nHowever, it’s important to approach this innovation with open eyes. Current limitations mean AI-generated videos are not\nyet completely indistinguishable from real footage in most cases. Videos are typically short (a few seconds long) and\nmay exhibit artifacts or surreal glitches, especially for complex motions or human anatomy. Ensuring a consistent\ncharacter or narrative across a longer video remains challenging (some models allow chaining multiple short clips, but\ntrue long-form consistency is still an R&D topic). There are also ethical considerations: generative video opens the\ndoor to hyper-realistic deepfakes or misleading content, which is a particular concern in regulated industries like\npharmaceuticals. The source of content leveraged, the machine learning processes used to create these capabilities,\nremains an open legal concern. As with any new technology, Lilly must weigh the potential benefits and risks together\nwhen determining a strategy for use and adoption. As we delve into the technology, differences between tools, and\nstrategies for adoption, we will highlight both the opportunities and risks.\nAI Video Generation Technology Overview\n​\nAt its core, AI video generation extends image generation with the dimension of time. Early approaches\ninvolved Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and recurrent models, but today’s state-of-the-art largely\nuses diffusion models with transformers trained on video data. A diffusion model gradually “denoises” random noise into\na coherent image; for video, this process is applied to a sequence of video frames (often in a latent compressed space\nto reduce computation). For example, OpenAI’s Sora model uses a latent video compressor and represents video as a series\nof “spacetime patches” that a transformer can process. The model is conditioned on a text prompt (and optionally\nstarting frames or images) and learns to predict the next frames of video that match the prompt. With enough training\n(using millions of videos and images), such a model can generate remarkably diverse and complex scenes.\nKey architectural innovations have improved video generation quality recently. One is the use of unified training on\nimages and videos – since images are essentially 1-frame videos, including large image datasets helps the model learn\nhigher resolution details. Sora, for instance, is a “generalist” trained on both images and videos of variable lengths,\nwhich enables it to output higher fidelity and longer durations (up to ~1 minute internally). Another advance is the\nincorporation of spatial-temporal attention mechanisms (as seen in Google’s and others’ models) that help preserve\nconsistency over time. Google DeepMind’s latest Veo 3 model reportedly uses 3D spatiotemporal attention and a\nspecialized 3D VAE (Variational Autoencoder) to achieve cinema-quality results. In practice, many systems break the task\ninto two stages: first generate a lower-resolution or lower-frame-rate video with AI, then upscale or interpolate it to\nHD and smooth frame rates (some platforms include built-in AI upscalers and frame interpolation to reach 1080p30 or\nbeyond).\nDespite these advances, current models have constraints. Most clip lengths are short – e.g. 4–5 seconds for many public\ntools, sometimes extendable to ~20 seconds with higher tiers or chaining clips. Maintaining object permanence and\ncharacter consistency across even those seconds is non-trivial (e.g. a person’s face might subtly change between frames\nif not controlled). Each frame must not only look plausible on its own but also flow logically from the previous,\nrespecting physics and causality. This is an area where models still stumble: early-gen systems produced warping limbs\nand melting objects under motion. Newer models are improving – for example, Minimax’s video model was noted to handle\nmotion physics (inertia, shadows, momentum) far more naturally than earlier models. Still, complex sequences (e.g. a\nhuman performing a sports move) can appear unnatural or “robotic” if the AI’s understanding of physics isn’t perfect.\nResolution and frame rate are other technical factors. Producing full 1080p or 4K frames is computationally heavy, so\nmany models trade off length or fidelity. Runway’s Gen-2 model, for instance, initially generated only ~480p-equivalent,\nlow-framerate videos (appearing “slideshow-like”) to conserve compute. Today there are models that directly output HD –\nOpenAI’s Sora Turbo can do 1080p and Adobe’s Firefly Video generates 1080p by default – but usually for very short clips\n(~5–10 seconds). Some platforms provide flexible aspect ratios and orientations (portrait, square, etc.), recognizing\nneeds for social media content.\nImportantly, AI video generators are increasingly handling multimodal inputs: not just plain text prompts, but\nalso image inputs (for image-to-video) and initial video clips (video-to-video). Image-to-video means you can give a\nsingle frame or picture and have the model animate it or use it as the scene start. Many tools (Runway, Pika, Sora,\nLuma, Adobe, etc.) support this because it helps with consistency and user control – e.g. you can provide a character\nimage to ensure the generated video revolves around that character’s appearance. Video-to-video allows taking an\nexisting video and transforming it (changing style or continuing it beyond original length). For example, Runway Gen-1\nwould take an input video and apply an AI-generated “style transfer” to turn real footage into an animated look. Several\nplatforms now let you extend videos by generating new frames after the last frame (both Sora and Google’s Flow have a\nfeature to “extend” or “continue” a clip seamlessly). These workflow features open the door to storyboard-driven\ngeneration: creators can stitch multiple AI clips into a longer sequence, maintaining some continuity by carrying over\nlast frames as the next clip’s start.\nAnother frontier is audio integration. Until recently, AI video tools have only produced silent clips – adding sound was\na separate task. Google’s Veo 3 made headlines by generating synchronized audio along with the video. This includes\nsound effects and even rudimentary voices or music that match the scene, greatly enhancing realism and emotional impact.\nWhile not yet common across all platforms, this indicates a trend toward full multimedia generation (Google achieved\nthis by drawing on its text-to-audio research and perhaps its new Gemini multimodal AI to understand the scene context).\nAdobe’s approach, meanwhile, integrates an AI voice model for dubbing/translation rather than generating sound effects\nfor imaginary scenes– an example of focusing on practical editing needs like translating a video’s narration into\nmultiple languages with matching lip sync. We anticipate more convergence of AI video + audio, enabling one-shot\ncreation of a complete video with soundtrack.\nFinally, content moderation and safety are built into the technology stack of responsible providers. Providers like\nOpenAI and Google constrain their models to avoid disallowed content (e.g. extreme violence, pornographic or hate\ncontent), and they add watermarks or metadata to identify AI-generated videos. OpenAI’s Sora, for example, attaches C2PA\nmetadata tags to all generated videos for transparency. Adobe trains Firefly on licensed, uncontroversial content to\nmake it “commercially safe” and avoid IP violations. These safeguards are critical given how easily video can mislead;\nthey are also important for adoption. For example, Lilly would have to ensure any AI-generated visuals do not\ninadvertently create off-label claims or inappropriate imagery. Additional layers of content moderation/control/filters\nwill remain a Lilly-specific need.\nIn summary, the key capabilities of AI video generation to be aware of include multiple dimensions to be evaluated as we\napproach new models and tools, including but not limited to:\nquality of visual output (resolution, frame rate, fidelity)\nability to portray realistic physics and lighting\noptions for camera movement/angles\ndegree of control via prompts and references (storyboards, keyframes, etc.)\nsupport for audio output and moderation features\nMajor Players and Platforms in AI Video Generation\n​\nThe AI video generation ecosystem in 2025 spans Big Tech companies, well-funded startups, and open-source projects.\nHaving surveyed these major players – OpenAI, Runway, Google, Kuaishou (Kling), Pika, MiniMax, Luma, Stability, Adobe –\nit’s evident that the field is crowded with innovation.\nEach brings something slightly different: OpenAI and Google push the frontier of capability, Adobe and Luma focus on\ncreator workflow integration, startups like Pika and MiniMax carve out specialized strengths or faster iteration, and\nopen projects like Stability ensure there’s room for custom solutions.\nBelow we break down the notable models/tools and their current state-of-the-art capabilities, as well as how they\ndiffer:\nOpenAI – Sora\n​\nOpenAI’s Sora is a cutting-edge text-to-video model introduced in early 2024 and moved out of research preview by the\nend of last year. It is designed as a general-purpose video generator that can take text (and optionally image/video\ninputs) and produce new videos. Sora operates as a consumer product via a web interface (ChaGPT.com and Sora.com) and\nthrough API integration with OpenAI and the Microsoft Azure platform. The latter of which, seems to be the most likely\navenue for Lilly’s adoption.\nSora was initially capable of up to 1 minute of video in research settings, but for end-users the service currently\nallows generating clips up to 20 seconds long at up to 1080p resolution. Users can choose aspect ratios (widescreen,\nsquare, vertical) and even bring their own assets – e.g. provide an initial or final frame, or a short video to\nbe extended or blended into new content. OpenAI has emphasized Sora’s prompt adherence and visual quality, aiming to\nclosely match the input description while keeping outputs photorealistic or stylistically high-quality. The model\nleverages a diffusion transformer architecture and was trained on an extremely large dataset of image and video content,\nmaking it a “generalist” that can handle everything from cartoon-like clips to natural scenery.\nOne of Sora’s distinguishing features is a built-in storyboard tool in its interface. This allows users to script out a\nsequence of scenes or specify key frames, giving more control over each moment in a longer narrative. For example, a\nuser could specify that at second 0 a character is in Location A, and by second 5 the character moves to Location B, and\nSora will try to fill in the transition. Such tools help mitigate the “consistency” problem by explicitly guiding the\nmodel. Sora also supports image-to-video (you can upload an image to influence the first frame or style)\nand video-to-video (upload a short clip to have Sora modify or continue it) generation, making it flexible in creative\nworkflows.\nStrengths:\nSora is backed by OpenAI’s leading research, so it benefits from state-of-the-art training and\nfine-tuning. It produces impressively detailed and vivid visuals across a range of subjects – reviewers have showcased\nexample prompts from cinematic city scenes to fantasy creatures, rendered with convincing lighting and depth of field.\nIt can maintain coherence for longer durations than many competitors (20s or more), and prompt alignment is generally\nstrong. The integration with ChatGPT means a large user base can experiment easily, and OpenAI has put in place\nrobust content moderation and origin tagging (every Sora video is cryptographically tagged as AI-generated). OpenAI’s\nbrand has also lead the GenAI field and continues to innovation across a variety of AI models and advanced capabilities.\nAdditionally, OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft makes it the most viable option for large enterprises, like Lilly.\nWeaknesses:\nDespite its prowess, Sora (like others) still has limitations. OpenAI itself notes that the model can\nstruggle with realistic physics and long complex actions – e.g. if a prompt involves a very intricate movement sequence,\nSora often introduces artifacts or odd motion. Early testers observed that human figures from Sora could have a stiff or\nunnatural motion compared to real video. Also, because of the computational cost, generating 20 seconds of HD video\nis resource intensive. The cost structure for heavy use is thus non-trivial; Lilly may want to negotiate custom pricing.\nAnother consideration is that Sora is a closed model – unlike some open-source alternatives, you cannot self-host or\nretrain it on proprietary data, so there is reliance on OpenAI’s innovation focus and reseller partner, Microsoft.\nOverall, Sora represents the high-quality, generalist approach to AI video: it aims to handle as many scenarios as\npossible with good quality and provide a safe, managed platform for users. It’s a bellwether for where mainstream AI\nvideo tech is, demonstrating realistic scene generation and moderate length, with expectation of rapid improvement as\nmodels scale further.\nRunway – Gen-2 (and beyond)\n​\nRunway ML is a startup well-known among creatives for providing accessible AI tools, and they were one of the first to\noffer text-to-video generation to the public. Runway’s Gen-2 model (launched mid-2023) garnered attention as a\ncommercially available text-to-video system available via a simple web interface. It followed their earlier Gen-1, which\nwas limited to video stylization (applying AI-generated styles to existing videos). Gen-2 marked the ability to generate\ncompletely new video frames from a text prompt or an image prompt. Users could sign up on Runway’s website and generate\nshort clips (initially ~4 seconds long) for free or with a subscription. This early availability made Runway Gen-2 a\npopular choice for designers and artists to experiment with AI video in 2023.\nGen-2 outputs a few seconds of video at low resolution (around 720×1280 or less) and without sound. It supports text\nprompts as well as an image + text combo – for example, you can upload a reference photo and ask it to animate that\nscene with some described action. The generation process is cloud-based and quick (often under a minute to get results).\nRunway’s interface emphasizes ease of use: you enter a prompt, hit generate, and get a preview you can download as an\nMP4. Gen-2 can produce some artistic and creative results, but it has notable limitations. Reviewers found that Gen-2’s\nvideos were often choppy in frame rate (almost like a fast slideshow) and grainy in appearance. This appears to have\nbeen a trade-off to make the service widely accessible (lowering GPU requirements by limiting quality). Gen-2 also\nstruggled with complex prompts – it might latch onto one word and ignore nuance, and it failed at precise instructions\nlike “a slow zoom-in” (the output didn’t execute the camera move). Consistency issues were present: objects could warp,\nand human figures often had surreal artifacts (blended limbs, etc.).\nRunway has been continuously improving its models. By late 2023, they were experimenting with features to increase\ncoherence (some community members referred to a Gen-3 or new features like “last frame continuity” – allowing one\ngeneration’s last frame to carry into the next, somewhat like what others call extend or storyboard). It’s reported\nthat Runway Gen-4 is on the horizon, aiming for higher quality and longer duration, but as of early 2025 the Gen-2 model\n(with incremental upgrades) is what’s publicly available. Runway’s comparative advantage is being creator-focused: their\nplatform is an all-in-one creative suite, with tools for video editing, composting, and AI effects. For instance, Runway\noffers green screen background removal and image generation in the same app, so a user can mix AI video with other\nediting easily. The price of Runway is subscription-based, with a free tier that gives some generation credits and paid\ntiers for more usage.\nRunway shows the accessibility side of AI video. It may not have the absolute best fidelity, but it pioneered getting\nthe tech into users’ hands. This has allowed a community of artists to develop around it (for example, the first AI\nmusic videos were often made with Runway Gen-2, accepting the rough edges as an aesthetic). Runway’s trajectory suggests\nthey will continue to close the quality gap. Notably, Runway collaborated in the development of Stable Diffusion (image\nmodel) previously, indicating strong AI research chops. We anticipate Runway’s future models will improve frame\nsmoothness and possibly length (their roadmap mentions working towards 15+ second clips). Businesses might use Runway\ncurrently for quick prototypes or social media content where a slightly stylized or surreal look is acceptable. However,\nfor polished, photoreal marketing videos, other solutions (or further model maturity) would be needed.\nGoogle – Veo 3 and Flow\n​\nGoogle entered the AI video arena through its DeepMind team, and in May 2025 it announced Veo 3, a next-generation video\nmodel, along with a tool called Flow for creators. Veo 3 represents one of the most advanced text-to-video models to\ndate, notable for delivering high realism and integrated audio. In tests, Veo 3 generated videos of realistic human\nactors with synchronized sound and music, a leap in overall cinematic quality. For example, an Ars Technica report\ndescribes Veo 3 producing a clip of a person that was startlingly close to real footage, complete with background music\nthat fit the mood. This puts Veo 3 at the cutting edge, potentially ahead of OpenAI’s and others’ models in certain\naspects as of mid-2025.\nVeo 3 can generate HD video content with accompanying audio in response to a prompt. It excels at text rendering within\nvideo (e.g. generating legible signage or captions in the scene – something many image AIs fail at); testers found Veo 3\nmore consistently renders written text correctly in frames compared to others. The audio component means if your prompt\nimplies a sound (“a dog barking in a park”), the output video might have a barking sound. This dramatically increases\nthe emotional impact and usefulness of the raw generations. Veo 3’s visual fidelity is extremely high: natural motion,\nbetter handling of complex scenes (e.g. multiple characters or dynamic camera movements) and fewer obvious glitches have\nbeen reported. It uses heavy-duty AI (likely an evolution of Google’s Imagen Video research combined with their Gemini\nmultimodal model) and thus is computationally demanding – one test noted ~5 minutes or more to generate a clip with\nGoogle’s servers.\nFlow\n​\nTo make Veo 3 accessible, Google launched Flow, an AI filmmaking web app. Flow is essentially the user interface and\nworkflow around Veo (and other models like Google’s Imagen image model). It’s available to Google’s AI Cloud subscribers\n(Pro and Ultra tiers) as a beta tool. Flow is built “with and for creatives” and introduces robust storytelling\nfeatures: you can generate individual shots using Text to Video, Frames to Video, or Ingredients to Video. Frames to\nVideo lets you specify a start and end frame (essentially keyframes) and the AI will animate the transition. Ingredients\nto Video means you can feed the AI specific elements – e.g. an image of a character or an art style – and it will ensure\nthe output video includes those elements. This modular approach helps keep characters consistent and styles unified\nacross scenes. Flow also has a Scene Builder: once you have a clip you like, you can add it to Scene Builder and then\neither “Extend” the scene (Flow will use the last second of frames to continue the action into a new clip) or “Jump to”\na new scene (preserving context like the main character, but allowing a change of setting or action). This approach\nleverages Google’s powerful Gemini AI behind the scenes to maintain coherence when transitioning shots. In effect, Flow\nallows the creation of a multi-shot short film completely within the AI tool, something quite revolutionary. When\nfinished, users can upscale their clips to 1080p and download them or even get GIF previews.\nStrengths:\nGoogle’s solution is arguably the most comprehensive and advanced: highest quality visuals with audio,\nand a pro-oriented workflow that tackles many prior limitations (short length, lack of consistency, etc.). The\nintegrated audio is a standout – in comparisons, testers found scenes from Veo 3 much more engaging due to background\nsounds and music, even when Kling (a competitor) had slightly better prompt accuracy in some cases. Veo 3 also shows\nstrength in cinematography: it tends to choose cinematic camera angles and color grading that enhance the prompt’s mood.\nThis may be due to training on film footage or specific tuning. Google’s cloud infrastructure means it can roll this out\nat scale when ready (currently it’s limited to certain users but expected to expand). Google will likely integrate these\ncapabilities into Google Cloud offerings (GCP), making it easier to use via API or within Google’s productivity tools in\nthe future.\nWeaknesses:\nThe main drawbacks are accessibility and cost. As of now, Flow (with Veo 3) is not open to everyone –\nit’s an exclusive service for paid subscribers, likely with limited invites. The compute intensity also means it’s slow\n(minutes per generation) and presumably expensive; Google’s tiered credits system in Flow indicates heavy usage could\nrack up costs (Flow has “Fast” and “Highest Quality” modes, with Highest using Veo 3 and consuming more credits). In\ntesting, system congestion led to errors for Veo 3 generation, implying the service can be bottlenecked. Another\nconsideration is that while Veo 3 pushes realism, it’s not infallible – some prompts found its prompt adherence weaker\nthan a rival in specific aspects. For example, in a test prompt of “a woman runs away from a giant spider,” Kling’s\nmodel actually showed the woman running away from the spider (as instructed) while Veo 3’s output had the elements but\nnot the exact action. So creative control might still need multiple attempts or careful prompt tuning. Also, if using\nFlow’s image-to-video via “Ingredients” mode, note that those videos apparently come without audio (so the audio\ngeneration only occurs in pure text-to-video mode, at least currently).\nGoogle’s entry with Veo 3 is a sign that AI video is reaching new heights. Lilly should watch this space because what is\na limited release today could be a widely available tool in a year. If Google integrates Flow into its ecosystem it\ncould accelerate adoption dramatically. In terms of strategy, Google’s heavy emphasis on storytelling workflow (e.g. the\nScene Builder and keyframes) suggests that even as AI gets more powerful, human creative direction remains crucial – the\nwinners will be those who combine AI capabilities with clear narrative guidance.\nKuaishou – Kling\n​\nKling is an AI video generator developed by Kuaishou, a major Chinese social media and short-video company (often seen\nas a rival to ByteDance). Kuaishou launched Kling in 2024 and has rapidly iterated on it; by mid-2025 they\nreleased Kling 2.1, explicitly targeting the leadership in AI video generation. Kling has gained a reputation for\nproducing cinema-grade short videos and is widely used in China for creating meme videos, animated satires, and more. In\nfact, Kling became popular among meme-makers to animate political satire videos of public figures (e.g. face-swapping\nfamous people into movie scenes). This hints at Kling’s strengths in generating reasonably realistic human\ncharacters and its permissiveness (though presumably with some safeguards).\nKling stands out for allowing relatively long outputs – up to 2 minutes of video in its latest version, far surpassing\nmost Western counterparts currently. It also supports high resolution (1080p) generation and smooth frame rates (25+\nFPS). To handle different use cases, Kling 2.1 is offered in multiple quality tiers. According to a review, there\nare Standard, Professional, and Master modes: Standard produces 720p ~5-second clips, Pro yields 1080p with good\nquality, and Master (the most advanced) also at 1080p but with maximum fidelity and consistency. The Master tier uses\nthe latest model with those 3D spatial-temporal techniques we mentioned, and it is slower and costlier (100 credits for\n5s, vs 35 credits for Pro). Notably, prompt adherence in Kling 2.1 is reported to be excellent – it captures complex\ninstructions well and keeps on-script better than many models. For instance, if asked to show specific text on a robot’s\nbody and a certain action, Kling usually gets the details right (especially in Master mode). It does have some\ndifficulty if the text or element is not the main focus (it might drop minor details when focusing on bigger things),\nbut overall its accuracy to the prompt is a selling point.\nKling offers a rich set of features akin to others: text-to-video, image-to-video, video extension, camera control, even\nface and lip-sync capabilities. The platform lists tools like Motion Brush (perhaps to guide motion in a specific\nregion), Start/End Frame input (like keyframes), Virtual Try-On (indicating a specialization in changing outfits on\npeople in video), and Lip Sync which suggests you can input audio dialogue and have a generated character speak it. This\naligns with Kuaishou’s needs for user-generated content (imagine an app where users can type a script and have an AI\navatar video speak it). Kling also provides an API, meaning developers can integrate it into apps or pipelines. The\nvolume of content generated is huge – by one report, Kling had already output over 10 million videos within a short time\nof launch, reflecting its popularity on a large social platform.\nStrengths:\nKling’s natural motion and authenticity have been highlighted. A Decrypt comparison noted Kling 2.1\nproduces footage that looks genuinely cinematic, with characters moving naturally and complex action sequences playing\nout without obvious AI artifacts. Emotions on faces feel more authentic than prior models in some tests. Also,\nKling’s fast pace of improvement is notable: within one year, Kuaishou jumped from version 1.0 to 2.1, each time\ntightening the gap with the cutting edge. The multi-tier offering is smart for business use – one can use cheaper modes\nfor drafts and then upscale final output with Master mode. For an enterprise, Kling could be cost-effective especially\nfor image-to-video tasks; in fact, tests found Kling 2.1 excels at image-to-video conversion (turning a static image\ninto a moving scene) relative to peers. Its camera movements and VFX are also advanced; for example, it can handle\ndynamic shots (one test had it do a time-lapse city transformation with camera movement – challenging, but it partially\nsucceeded). The presence of specialized effects (like presumably the Elements or VFX presets on their site) means it\nmight offer fun creative filters natively.\nWeaknesses:\nOne limitation is accessibility for non-Chinese users. Kling’s official interface is primarily in\nChinese (though Pollo AI, a third-party site, provides an English gateway to try Kling models). Payment and support\nmight be geared towards Chinese market, so international enterprise adoption could be tricky at the moment. Another\nfactor: while Kling leads in some metrics, Google’s Veo 3 has the edge in integrated audio and possibly in overall\n“atmosphere” (color grading, etc.). In a direct face-off, each had scenarios where it did better: Kling was better at\nstrictly following the action described, whereas Veo’s clip with audio delivered a more cinematic feel even if it\ndeviated slightly. Also, Kling’s Master mode, though high-quality, is compute-heavy – some users might find the wait\ntimes (and costs) for the highest quality prohibitive for very iterative work. Lastly, as an AI that can do\ndeepfake-like outputs (given meme usage and lip-sync), one must ensure ethical use. It’s likely Kuaishou has moderation\non their platform, but if one is using the API, compliance with any deepfake laws (like requiring disclaimers for\nAI-generated realistic people) is necessary.\nIn summary, Kling is a powerhouse in AI video and a direct competitor to Sora and Veo. For our global company, Kling\ndemonstrates that the Chinese market has an opportunity to leverage models not accessible to all geographies. Minimally,\nit’s a model to benchmark against. Lilly should keep an eye on whether Kuaishou or partners make Kling available\nglobally, and on the kinds of content it enables (e.g. it’s very adept at producing short-form, eye-catching clips which\nis exactly the content driving social media engagement).\nPika Labs – Pika Video\n​\nPika Labs is a startup that has quickly risen in the AI video field. Co-founded by two PhD students in 2023, Pika Labs\nmade waves by mid-2024 when it secured a US$135 million funding round, valuing the company at $470M. This substantial\nbacking (notably involving investors from both the US and Asia) signals that Pika is viewed as a serious contender.\nPika’s AI video generator – often just called Pika AI – is known for being user-friendly and creatively versatile. It’s\noffered via a web interface and API, and has even been integrated into third-party creative apps (e.g. the Captions app\nintegrated Pika to allow users to generate b-roll clips from text inside a video editing workflow).\nPika supports both text-to-video and image-to-video, similar to others. It can generate approximately 5-second clips by\ndefault, and the team has been extending that (the platform notes up to ~2 minutes by chaining or iterating, likely in\ntheir newer version 1.5+). The resolution it works with is around 720p (1296×720) in current versions for generation.\nPika’s style flexibility is a strong suit – it can do “various styles, such as cinematic, animated, or cartoonish” just\nby adjusting the prompt or selecting presets. They have been updating the model rapidly (the Pollo AI interface shows\nPika v2.2 as latest, implying several version jumps). One unique feature Pika introduced is “Pika Effects”\n(dubbed Pikaffects). These are essentially AI-driven video effects that manipulate objects in the generated scene. For\nexample, users can apply effects like Inflate, Melt, Explode, Squash, Crush, or even “Cake-ify” to objects. This\nsuggests if you generate a video of, say, a statue, you could then have it melt or explode in a physically plausible way\nvia the AI – an exciting tool for dynamic visuals and likely very popular for fun content creation. This focus\non object-level control is somewhat unique to Pika and caters to short-form video creativity (imagine TikTok-style\nvisual gags, etc.).\nPika’s interface is noted to be intuitive for newcomers. They likely have templates or guided workflows (enter your\nprompt, choose a style, etc.). Also, Pika Labs has emphasized continuity features: much like others, you can use the\nlast frame of one video as the first of the next to string together longer scenes with a persistent character. A\ncommunity of users have tested Pika’s capability on things like B-roll (it does well in generating generic footage like\ntech product pans), cartoon animation (smooth results), and abstract visuals.\nStrengths:\nPika appears to combine research-grade tech with a product mindset. Raising $135M so early means they\nhave resources to push the model’s quality and scale quickly. Already by June 2024, Pika’s results were impressing many\n– it produces smooth camera movements and lighting effects, and in some comparisons was among the top for certain tests.\nFor instance, a Medium reviewer noted Minimax and Pika as two standout platforms that “actually work” for creators\nneeding reliable output. Pika’s multi-style capability means marketers or creators can use it for a range of content: a\nrealistic stock-footage-like clip for one project, a whimsical cartoon for another. The Pikaffects give an extra\ndimension of creativity, allowing users to generate not just static scenes but scenes with an effect or\ntransformation (great for grabbing viewer attention). Pika also supports API integration, which means businesses can\nbuild it into their own tools or pipelines (for example, an e-learning platform could call Pika’s API to generate custom\nvideo illustrations on the fly for course content). Finally, Pika’s background – co-founders with strong academic\ncredentials (one profile mentions a co-founder, Wenjing Guo, is a Harvard CS grad lauded as a “genius girl” in China) –\nsuggests a talent advantage and possibly cross-collaboration between US and Chinese AI communities.\nWeaknesses:\nWhile Pika is promising, it’s still an upstart in a field with emerging giants. Its model may not yet\nmatch the absolute fidelity of OpenAI or Google’s latest – for example, resolution being 720p vs others pushing 1080p,\nand it’s unclear if Pika has audio generation (likely not at the moment; most mention is about visuals). Some features\nin Pika are marked as “v1” or “v1.5” in comparison tables, indicating they are in active development (e.g. perhaps\nmotion brush or mid-frame control is not fully there yet). Also, as a smaller company, Pika might not have as extensive\ncontent filtering or enterprise support as OpenAI, Adobe, and Google, so Lilly would need to vet its outputs carefully\nfor IP or moderation issues. The competitive landscape is another challenge – multiple competitors means Pika needs to\ndifferentiate; it seems to do so with effects and ease-of-use, but others can emulate those too. Pika’s strength in\n“various styles” could also mean it might not yet dominate any one style in quality (jack of all trades risk).\nFor Lilly, Pika Labs is a startup to watch or possibly partner/invest/acquire. Its agility means new features (like\nthose quirky video effects) come out quickly, which could be leveraged for marketing novelty. For instance, our creative\nteams might use Pika to generate an attention-grabbing visual clip (imagine a pill that “explodes” into confetti to\nsymbolize treatment success – an effect Pika might handle well). With its sizable funding, Pika could also become a\ntakeover target or major player globally. The key will be how they scale their service and continue improving model\nperformance.\nMiniMax – Hailuo Video-01\n​\nMiniMax is a Chinese startup (behind the model named Hailuo Video-01) that has also made a name for itself among AI\nvideo creators. Often just referred to as “MiniMax video generator,” it gained recognition in late 2023 for delivering\nimpressively realistic motion continuity at 720p resolution. MiniMax’s approach appears to prioritize the fundamental\nchallenges of video generation: physics, continuity, and camera work.\nHailuo Video-01, as offered by MiniMax, generates high-definition (720p) videos at 25 fps and supports\nboth text-to-video and image-to-video modes. A typical output is ~5 seconds long, but users have successfully stitched\nclips to create longer sequences (one user made a 30-second video by concatenating 5s segments, with seamless flow).\nMiniMax particularly shines with cinematic camera movements – reviewers were impressed by how well it handled complex\npans and drone-like aerial shots while keeping the scene coherent. For example, flying over a beach then tilting toward\na waterfall in one continuous motion was executed smoothly. The model also excelled at B-roll style footage: generating\na professional-looking slow-motion laptop product shot with correct focus and lighting transitions. This indicates\nstrong understanding of focus depth, blur, and other cinematographic details.\nIn terms of content, MiniMax did very well with cartoon animations and abstract visuals. It produces smooth,\nhigh-quality cartoon motion, making it great for creators of animated shorts. And for abstract or surreal scenes, it\nmaintained immersive and stunning visuals. When it comes to continuity, MiniMax has a feature where you can take the\nlast frame of a clip and feed it as the first frame of the next generation – this allowed that 30-second continuous\nvideo with a character, where the character stayed consistent throughout. That consistency is a major plus; the user\nessentially stiched longer stories by manual continuity, and the tool worked nicely.\nStrengths:\nMiniMax’s biggest strength is realistic motion physics. Movements in its videos look real and believable\n– the AI seems to have a better grasp of inertia and momentum, avoiding the jerky or floaty feel others sometimes have.\nIn side-by-side tests, motions that looked robotic in Sora were more lifelike in MiniMax, suggesting their model\narchitecture may explicitly model physics or was trained on plenty of real video. The continuity (the ability to chain\nclips) is another strength, enabling content creators to tell longer stories if needed. Also, MiniMax’s output quality\nfor its resolution is high – 720p might sound lower than 1080p, but given many AI videos are still in that ballpark,\nMiniMax’s effective quality is top-tier within that. It is also reportedly free or low-cost to try (it was available on\nplatforms like Anakin.ai for users to experiment), which has helped it gain traction among the community.\nWeaknesses:\nMiniMax isn’t as globally known as some others, and documentation in English is sparse.\nIts image-to-video with humans was noted as a weak spot – when given a real human photo to animate, the results were not\nvery convincing (unnatural transitions, lack of detail). It performed better with cartoonish images than real human\nphotos. So for tasks like animating a real person’s photo, it may not be the best (other specialized avatar tools or\nSynthesia might do better). Also, MiniMax had difficulty with very complex movement scenarios – e.g. a football player\nkicking a ball, where precise interaction is needed, looked clunky. This suggests limits in handling intricate\nmulti-object physics (ball interacting with foot etc.). Another limitation is that, at least as of late 2024, MiniMax\noutputs were capped to short durations and required manual effort to chain longer videos – it doesn’t inherently\ngenerate a 30s story in one go; you have to curate it scene by scene.\nFor Lilly, MiniMax’s existence is proof that there are multiple players beyond the most hyped. If we want to focus on\nexperimenting with as many options as possible, MiniMax would be a good model to assess for scenarios needing believable\nmovement (say you want an AI video of a pill bottle gently rotating and tilting – physics heavy – MiniMax might nail\nthat). However, since it’s less of a full product and more of a model accessible via certain interfaces or APIs\n(Segmind, Replicate, etc.), leveraging it requires engineering or technical integrations if not working with a provider\nthat offers the model as part of a service. It’s one of the “behind the scenes” engines that some AI video platforms\ncould incorporate for their motion strengths.\nLuma Labs – Dream Machine (Ray 2)\n​\nLuma AI is known for its 3D scanning and NeRF (neural radiance field) technology, which allows creating 3D models from\nphone captures. In 2023, Luma expanded into generative AI with its Dream Machine app, aiming to be a “visual thought\npartner” for both images and videos. Luma’s Dream Machine is unique in that it blends 2D and 3D AI capabilities: it\nincludes an image generation model (Photon) and a video model (Ray 2) working in tandem. The focus is on giving\ncreators fluid control and fast iteration in making spectacular visuals without needing prompt engineering skills.\nDream Machine allows you to generate both images and videos and move seamlessly between them. Notably, you can\nuse natural language to not only create but also edit and refine outputs (e.g. “make it a 90s vibe” or “add a fisheye\nlens effect” to modify an image/video). For videos, Luma’s Ray 2 model is designed for fast, coherent motion and\nultra-realistic details. Dream Machine includes robust features for controlling outputs: you can “Direct the perfect\nshot with start/end frames” – meaning keyframe control similar to Adobe’s and Google’s approach. You can also “loop” a\nvideo seamlessly if desired. It emphasizes ability to create unique, consistent characters from a single image – so you\nprovide an image of a character and the AI can generate new scenes with that character consistently present. There’s\nalso support for visual style references: you can upload or select reference images for style or specific elements,\nguiding the generation.\nDream Machine’s interface touts features like Brainstorm (the AI suggests ideas or variations if you’re not sure where\nto go next), and Share & Remix which encourages a community aspect (users can share their creations and even the “behind\nthe scenes” prompt+refs so others can iterate on them). Under the hood, Photon (image model) helps ensure any single\nframe or detail is high-quality, while Ray 2 (video model) handles the temporal aspect – this dual approach likely\ncontributes to the sharp, detailed frames and accurate text rendering that Luma claims (they specifically list “sharp\nand accurate text rendering” as a feature, implying their model can place legible text in video). They also\nhighlight “accurate lighting and physics” and “clean and consistent animation style”, indicating the model was trained\nto respect physical realism and maintain a coherent style throughout a clip.\nStrengths:\nLuma’s Dream Machine is praised for its polished user experience. Tom’s Guide in late 2024 called it “one\nof the best interfaces” among AI video platforms. This ease and fluidity could reduce the learning curve for non-AI\nexperts. The range of control is also a key strength: Dream Machine basically offers every control feature we’ve\ndiscussed – keyframes, reference images, style control, camera movement, looping, region modifications – within one app.\nThis is very powerful for artists or marketing teams who want to fine-tune outputs to match brand guidelines (e.g.\nensuring a brand mascot stays on-model, or a scene has the exact color palette desired). Moreover, Ray 2 being a\n“large-scale video model” indicates it has been trained extensively, likely yielding very high success rates of usable\ngenerations (Luma claims Ray2 outputs are “substantially more production-ready” than prior gen video AI). Dream\nMachine’s ability to generate both images and videos means users can prototype a concept with still images (faster) and\nthen seamlessly switch to video mode to animate it – this interoperability can save time and ensure consistency between\ncampaign imagery and videos.\nWeaknesses:\nLuma Dream Machine might be slightly under the radar in enterprise circles compared to OpenAI,\nMicrosoft, Google or Adobe. It’s a newer entrant and was initially iOS-only (though now on web too). Being an app that\ntargets creatives, it might not yet have the integrations into enterprise tech stacks or the compliance features\nbusinesses need (no mention of watermarking or governance, for instance). Also, its output length is not explicitly\nstated – likely similar short durations, possibly extendable with looping or chaining. If someone wants a 30-second\npolished piece, they may have to puzzle-piece multiple generations. Additionally, while having lots of control is great\nfor power users, it could overwhelm others; Luma tries to mitigate this with the Brainstorm auto-suggestions, but using\nall features effectively might require training/experience.\nFor Lilly, Luma could be a fantastic prototyping tool – e.g. you could create a complex scene of a molecular world or\npatient journey, iterating quickly with text prompts and tweaks until it’s right, then generate final video frames. Its\nstrength in “exceptional adherence to detailed instruction” means if you have a very specific storyboard or shot list,\nDream Machine might follow it closely. It’s also worth noting Luma’s heritage in 3D: they might eventually integrate\ntrue 3D scene generation or AR content, which could be useful for pharma (think interactive 3D MOA visuals). At present\nthough, Dream Machine is a strong sign that user experience and granular control are becoming differentiators in AI\nvideo platforms.\nStability AI – Stable Video Diffusion\n​\nStability AI, known for open-source image generator Stable Diffusion, has also ventured into video. In late 2023, they\nreleased Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) in research preview. This model is based on Stable Diffusion’s image generation\nbut extended to produce short videos. True to Stability’s mission, the model was open-sourced (code on GitHub and\nweights on HuggingFace) for researchers and developers. This makes Stable Video Diffusion an important project for those\nwho want custom or self-hosted AI video solutions.\nThe initial release of Stable Video Diffusion can generate very short clips – specifically 14 or 25 frames of video. At\ncommon frame rates, that’s roughly 0.5 to 1 second of footage, so extremely brief, although one can run it sequentially\nto make a few seconds. It allows setting a frame rate between 3 and 30 fps for those frames. The focus was on proving\nthe concept and providing a foundation to build on, rather than competing on length/quality with commercial models.\nStability mentioned the model could handle different frame rates and aspect ratios in principle, and that with\nfinetuning it could do tasks like multi-view (novel view) synthesis – e.g. generating different angles of a scene from\none input image. They positioned it as a base model on top of which many specialized video models might be built,\nsimilar to how Stable Diffusion spawned many fine-tuned image models for various styles.\nStability also launched a beta web interface (as a waitlist) for text-to-video using this model, and an API on their\ndeveloper platform. By 2024’s end, they announced Stable Video 4D 2.0, which was geared towards “4D generation and novel\nview synthesis from a single video input”. This suggests a branch of their work focusing on turning a single video into\na 3D scene or generating new angles (useful for AR/VR or VFX where you need more camera coverage).\nStrengths:\nThe big advantage of Stable Video Diffusion is openness and customizability. Researchers have full access\nto the model to fine-tune on their own data, which could be useful for a company wanting a model trained specifically\non, say, pharmaceutical TV commercials or lab experiment videos (ensuring output is in-domain). Also, because it’s based\non Stable Diffusion, it benefits from a huge open-source community. Already enthusiasts have built demos like\nimage-to-video “animation” notebooks and integrated SVD into tools (one example: a free web tool offered\nstable-video-diffusion image-to-video with trial runs). Stability claimed that at release, their model “surpass[ed] the\nleading closed models in user preference studies” – if true, that’s a strong endorsement of quality, though it might\nrefer to comparisons with earlier or simpler models. The speed is decent; Stability said it can create videos in “2\nminutes or less” for those short clips, and being lightweight means it could run on accessible hardware eventually (they\noften optimize models for consumer GPUs). For a company with skilled ML engineers and low risk tolerance, Stable Video\nDiffusion provides a platform to customize without needing to send data to third-party APIs.\nWeaknesses:\nIn terms of raw capability, SVD lags behind the likes of Sora, Veo, or others in this list. The\nextremely short length (1 second) and likely lower resolution (their paper suggests training at smaller resolutions)\nmean it’s not immediately useful for direct content creation yet – more of a tech demo. It doesn’t produce audio. Also,\nusing it requires ML expertise; it’s not an off-the-shelf product for end-users. Stability’s emphasis on research means\npolished features like storyboards or content moderation are left to the implementer. Indeed, one has to be careful: an\nopen model might produce disallowed content if fine-tuned incorrectly, and the onus is on the user to enforce moderation\nor filtering.\nStable Video Diffusion is relevant if you have a strategy around open-source AI and want to possibly build in-house\ncapability. A pharma company might, for example, fund a project to fine-tune SVD on their library of MOA animation\nframes to create a custom model that generates new scientific animations consistent with their style – something you\nwouldn’t want to put into a public model for IP reasons. That could be a competitive differentiator long-term. Stability\nAI also tends to improve their models iteratively, and with community contributions, so by late 2025 we might see SVD\n2.0 that can do several seconds at higher quality. It’s the “keep an eye on this if you want a differentiated AI video\nsolution” contender.\nAdobe – Firefly Generative Video\n​\nAdobe is integrating generative AI across its Creative Cloud, and for video content Adobe’s solution is the Firefly\nVideo Model (often just called Generative Video in Firefly). Announced in 2024 and rolled out in beta this April (2025),\nAdobe’s tool is a bit different in focus from others: it’s designed to enhance video editing workflows (think of it as\nan assistant to Premiere Pro users) rather than to replace the video camera entirely. Adobe is leveraging its vast\nlibrary of licensed assets (Adobe Stock) to train this model, ensuring the outputs are commercially safe for use (no\nunlicensed content).\nAs of launch, Firefly’s generative video supports two main generation modes: Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video. Users can\nenter a descriptive prompt to get a 5-second, 1080p video clip. Crucially, Adobe’s tool allows uploading a start frame\nand end frame to guide the motion. This is essentially keyframe control: for example, you could upload a still image of\na scene as the start and another image for the end, and the AI will animate a transition between them. Firefly also\nprovides drop-down menus for camera shot size and angle, as well as presets for camera motion (e.g. pan, zoom, tilt) to\nfurther direct the result. This GUI approach aligns with Adobe’s pro users who may be more comfortable picking settings\nthan writing long textual prompts for everything.\nIn addition to generation, Adobe introduced Translate Video and Translate Audio features with the Firefly launch. These\nuse an AI voice model to dub existing videos into different languages (with some lip-sync capability for enterprise\nusers). While not generation from scratch, it’s a complementary AI feature that can be big for training or marketing –\ne.g. easily turn an English video into French, Spanish, etc., with the voice and lips aligned. It shows Adobe’s holistic\napproach: not just make new content, but modify and repurpose content efficiently.\nAdobe’s Firefly video is integrated in the cloud (firefly.adobe.com) as a beta, with plans to bring it into Premiere Pro\nlater. It emphasizes use cases like filling gaps in footage, generating b-roll of scenery, adding atmospheric\nelements to existing shots (like generate an overlay of smoke or dust on a green screen). Indeed, the FAQ suggests top\nuse cases as adding elements, animating static images (e.g. making a waterfall flow), or creating stylized graphics and\ntext animations.\nStrengths:\nAdobe’s key advantage is seamless integration for creatives. Editors can incorporate generative clips\nright inside their familiar tools (eventually in Premiere/AfterEffects), which lowers adoption friction. Also,\nthe ethics and legal safety – every Firefly output is trained on licensed content and can be used commercially with\nconfidence. This is a huge factor for enterprises worried about copyright (some companies avoid using other AI image\ngenerators due to unclear training data provenance; Adobe solves that). The resolution (1080p) and aspect ratio options\n(16:9 and 9:16 supported out of the gate) meet professional standards. Firefly’s camera and keyframe controls mean users\ncan get precisely the shot they envision – rather than hoping a pure text prompt yields the right camera angle, you can\nexplicitly say you want a “wide shot, overhead angle, slow dolly movement,” etc. This dramatically improves reliability\nfor production use, because it reduces ambiguity for the AI. Additionally, Adobe’s inclusion of translation and voice\nAI in the suite is a bonus for people who want an all-in-one solution for localizing and creating content.\nWeaknesses:\nFirefly’s generative video is currently limited to 5 seconds max for generation, which is shorter than\nsome competitors like Sora (20s) or Kling (minutes). It is clearly meant for quick clips and fillers, not full scenes.\nIf a marketing team wants to create a 30-second ad purely from AI, they’d need to string together many Firefly\ngenerations and likely do some manual stitching. Another limitation is that as of now it’s a separate web beta, not\nfully in Premiere – meaning an extra step to use (though this will likely change). The content domain might also be\nsomewhat constrained: given Adobe’s professional focus, the model might excel at certain types of shots (e.g. landscape\nb-roll, simple subject animations) but perhaps not be as wildly imaginative or diverse in style as some others. Early\nbeta users will certainly find edges to what it can do. Also, because Adobe prioritizes safe training data, the training\nset might exclude a lot of web videos – it’s likely biased towards stock footage and professionally created content.\nThis means it might not have learned some of the “internet’s imagination” that open models did; whether that’s a\ndownside (less breadth) or upside (more reliability) depends on use case.\nFor Lilly, Adobe’s generative video could be immediately useful in post-production enhancement. Imagine you have a live\naction commercial but need to add an effect – say a glowing aura around a patient to symbolize improvement – Firefly\ncould potentially generate that element on a transparent background to overlay. Or if you’re storyboarding a concept,\nyou can quickly generate video mockups of scenes to show stakeholders, all within the Adobe ecosystem. The translation\nfeature is directly relevant for global pharma marketing: you could take a video with an English voiceover and get a\nmultilingual version in minutes, which is often needed for global training or promotion (with the caveat that lip-sync\nfor different languages is still a work in progress). Adobe’s move also signals that AI video will be a standard tool in\ncreative departments, not a niche experiment.Shape\nIndustry Impact and Use Cases\n​\nThe advent of AI-generated video impacts multiple sectors. Here we focus on marketing, learning & development\n(L&D)/training, and specifically the pharmaceutical industry context, while noting broader implications:\nMarketing and Advertising\n​\nContent Volume & Personalization\n​\nMarketing teams are under pressure to produce more content than ever, tailored to different audiences and channels. AI\nvideo generation can produce quick video variants at scale. For example, a global brand campaign normally requires\nshooting different versions of an ad for each region – with generative AI, one could create localized versions by\nchanging the background, actors’ apparent ethnicity, language of on-screen text, etc., without a reshoot. AI video could\ngenerate the same scene in different hospital settings or swap the text on a prescription bottle label to a different\nlanguage, saving huge production costs. Personalized video ads (addressable TV or online ads) could also be\nauto-generated: an AI might create thousands of slight variations of a medical device ad, each tuned to a particular\ndemographic or even individual (with appropriate compliance checks).\nCreative Brainstorming & Prototyping\n​\nAI video is a boon to the creative process. Agencies should be saving time and passing cost savings to their customers\nwith tools like Sora or Luma’s Dream Machine to storyboard concepts in motion, not just static frames. This makes it\neasier for non-technical stakeholders to grasp a concept. Pharma marketing often involves explaining abstract concepts\n(like how a drug works in the body). Instead of expensive 3D animations made after weeks of work, a team could prototype\nan MOA animation with AI in a day to visualize the idea, then refine it. It accelerates the iteration cycle on creative\nideas. Several companies already use DALL-E or Midjourney for concept art – extending that to video is the next logical\nstep. Business leaders may appreciate seeing a mock commercial or animated concept early on, which guides\ndecision-making on whether to invest in a full production or adjust messaging.\nCost and Time Savings\n​\nParticularly for B-roll and filler content, AI can reduce or eliminate the need for stock footage or shoots. Need a\n5-second establishing shot of a laboratory at sunrise? Instead of searching stock libraries or setting up a shoot, an AI\ncould generate one that fits the precise vision. This is what Adobe is targeting – filling timeline gaps. Marketing\nvideos often have many such moments. Over time, as reliability improves, AI might handle even primary footage for\ncertain types of ads (especially animated or stylized ones). Lower production cost means marketers can do more A/B\ntesting of video ads by trying multiple versions. Lilly could use AI to make rapid tweaks post-approval (e.g. if a claim\nneeds a different visual emphasis, an AI could alter the scene accordingly without reshooting, if it doesn’t change the\napproved message).\nChallenges for Marketing\n​\nCreatives and brand teams must ensure brand consistency – ironically a potential issue with AI’s variability. We likely\nneed to lock down style guides and possibly train custom models on brand assets to keep outputs on-brand. There’s also\nreputational risk: poorly made AI videos could reflect badly if they slip through (imagine awkward visuals or errors –\nit could appear tone-deaf or unprofessional). So likely, in near term, AI video will be used for internal drafts, social\nmedia (where lower fidelity is more acceptable), or supplemental content, while critical campaigns still use high-end\nproduction with AI augmentation. Over time, as quality stabilizes, this will shift.\nLearning & Development / Training\n​\nScenario Simulations: In corporate or medical training, video role-plays and scenarios are common (e.g. demonstrating\ndoctor-patient interactions, or proper use of a device). AI video can produce custom training scenarios on demand. For\nexample, a pharma sales training could generate a video of a physician consultation scenario tailored to a specific\nspecialty or objection handling – without hiring actors. Tools like Synthesia already generate talking avatar videos\nfrom text (not quite these full scene generators, but adjacent tech). With text-to-video, one could specify the scenario\nand have the AI create an original scene. Character consistency becomes key here; a trainer might want the same\nAI-generated actor to appear across multiple modules – technologies like DeepMotion or others could even give that AI\nactor movement. Google’s Flow enabling Jump to new shot while preserving character is highly relevant. That means you\ncould maintain the same virtual “person” in different situations.\nLocalized and Updated Content: L&D often needs to deliver content in multiple languages and keep it updated regularly.\nUsing generative video plus integrated voice translation (as Adobe Firefly offers), a training department can take an\nEnglish training video and automatically generate the French, Spanish, Chinese versions with dubbed voices and adjusted\nvisuals if needed. The AI can even lip-sync the translated speech to the video (Adobe is working on that for\nenterprise). Additionally, if a procedure changes or guidelines update, new training videos can be spun up quickly by\nediting the prompt or script, rather than reshooting footage. This is particularly useful in pharma where information\nchanges (new study data, new regulations requiring a tweak in message, etc.).\nMicro-learning and Personalized Learning: With AI, it’s plausible to generate personalized training videos for employees\nor customers. Imagine an onboarding video where the scenarios depicted are customized to that employee’s role or common\nknowledge gaps. Or patient education videos that adjust explanations to the patient’s literacy level or cultural context\n– AI could alter the scenery or analogies in the video accordingly. Such on-demand generation was impossible at scale\nwith traditional methods. Pharma companies doing patient support programs could benefit by tailoring educational content\n(for example, showing a patient of the same demographic in the video for relatability, which AI can swap out easily).\nChallenges in Training: Ensuring accuracy is paramount – any AI hallucination or incorrect depiction in a training video\ncould misinform, which in pharma could have serious consequences. Thus, for factual or procedural content, AI outputs\nmust be carefully reviewed, or possibly a hybrid approach used (AI generates visuals but humans script it tightly and\nverify every frame). There’s also an emotional quality aspect: human-made training videos use real actors to connect\nemotionally. AI avatars are improving, but there’s still an “uncanny valley” risk if not done well. Over time, as\ncharacter generation improves, this will lessen. Another challenge is platform adoption: training departments will need\nnew workflows to incorporate AI generation tools, and staff will require some upskilling (e.g. learning prompt-writing\nand basic editing of AI outputs).\nCommercial and Promotional\n​\nThe pharma industry, being highly regulated, will approach AI video with both excitement and caution. Here’s how it\nspecifically stands to gain or face challenges:\nMechanism of Action (MOA) and Scientific Visualization\n​\nPharma marketing relies on complex animations to show how a drug works in the body. These are expensive 3D animations\ntoday. In the future, a text prompt like “Show T-cells attacking a cancer cell, zoomed in at cellular level, cinematic\nlighting” could produce a decent MOA animation clip. Already, Sora’s examples (like wooly mammoths in a field, or waves\ncrashing on cliffs) indicate the ability to create nature and complex textures – extending to microscopic imagery is a\nquestion of training data. If we can fine-tune models on biomedical imagery, we could get AI that generates\nscientifically accurate animations quickly. This would let marketing and medical teams experiment with different visual\nmetaphors for MOA and pick the most effective ones. It could also be used in medical education – helping doctors\nvisualize mechanisms or trial results via generated visuals.\nHCP Marketing and Peer Influence\n​\nPharma often involves key opinion leaders (KOLs) giving talks or explaining data. In the near future, one can imagine\ngenerating avatar videos of KOLs presenting data, in multiple languages. While using a real person’s likeness has\nethical/IP issues (would need permission and careful use), generative tech could create a convincing virtual\nspokesperson. Alternatively, completely fictional yet authoritative-looking avatars might be used to relay information.\nThis could help scale expert content delivery (though likely for internal training or markets where the actual speaker\ncannot be present – regulations on promotional use of an AI “doctor” would be tricky).\nPatient Engagement\n​\nUsing AI, we could create more engaging patient resources – e.g. an AI-generated explainer cartoon for kids about how to\nuse an inhaler, or a reassuring scenario video for patients starting a new therapy showing what to expect. Emotional\nexpressiveness is something some models like Sora and Veo are working on. If an AI can portray empathy or excitement\nthrough a character’s face and voice, patient communication could benefit. However, Lilly should remember to be\ntransparent if an avatar or voice bot is being leveraged to maintain trust.\nCompliance and Moderation\n​\nEvery promo or medical video in pharma must go through approval for claims, safety info, etc. AI introduces a new\nvariable – the visuals might inadvertently introduce something non-compliant (e.g. showing a use of a drug that’s\noff-label). Content moderation tools will need to extend to video. We may need to adopt a practice of frame-by-frame\nreview of AI outputs just like they review every word of a brochure. This slows things, but some AI tools might allow\nlocking certain parameters to ensure compliance (for instance, an AI could be instructed not to show the pill being\ntaken with any other medication or not to depict certain patient populations if not approved). As OpenAI noted with\nSora, their deployed model is limited in what it can show realistically (some complex or sensitive scenarios are\nfiltered). Lilly will need even tighter guardrails when using AI video generation.\nSummary\n​\nIf harnessed well, Lilly could significantly increase engagement with both physicians and patients. Video content that\nwas once too costly to produce for smaller audiences (like a rare disease community) could be made cost-effectively with\nAI, making communications more visual and relatable. It also opens up possibility for interactive content – e.g. a\nvoicebot experience where a patient’s questions trigger dynamically generated video answers (a far future concept, but\nnot impossible as tech converges). Another area is internal communications: using AI to generate internal announcement\nvideos or CEO messages (with consent of course) to add a personal touch without pulling executives into studio every\ntime.\nThe biggest risks are legal (IP considerations), regulatory, and inaction. Pharma is already under scrutiny for how it\nmarkets – if it came out that an AI generated video inadvertently created a misleading impression (even subtly, via\nimagery), or leveraged an a tool associated with copyright infringement, it could result in legal penalties or public\ntrust issues.\nStrategies for Adoption\n​\nFor anyone planning to leverage AI video generation, here are strategic considerations and steps:\nWatch and Experiment (Now): It’s important to stay informed on this fast-moving field (as this report has shown,\nupdates in 2024-2025 were frequent). Assign a team or innovation leader to experiment with various tools – e.g. a\ncreative or technology team who can consistently assess models and output across a wide range of features and\ncapabilities – leveraging the same prompts or end goal in mind. Encourage sharing of results and set up brainstorming\nsessions on “What could we do with this in our business?”\nDetermine High-Impact Use Cases (Now): Not every video needs to be AI-generated. Look for pain points or\nopportunities in your current content pipeline: Is it hard to get budget for certain types of videos (maybe training\nscenarios or international market content)? Those are prime targets to try AI. For Lilly, maybe start with non-public\ncontent (internal training, mechanism explainer for reps) to avoid regulatory risk while the tech is still new.\nAnother ideal use case is social media: social teams always need fresh short videos – AI can help create those\nquickly and the lower stakes environment (a playful Twitter video) can tolerate slightly less polish.\nDraft Policy and Guidelines (Now): Just as there are guidelines for using stock images or social media conduct,\ncreate guidelines for AI-generated content. This includes: what types of content are allowed (e.g. perhaps no AI\ngeneration of real person likenesses without permission to avoid deepfake issues, or avoid certain sensitive health\nscenarios to be safe); requirement that every AI video is reviewed by a subject matter expert for accuracy; and\nguidelines for disclosure (if needed). For external content, consider transparency – for example, some companies\nmight add a line in the video description that it contains AI-generated imagery, especially if regulations or brand\ntrust demands it. Given OpenAI’s Sora tags metadata, if an image verification tool sees it’s AI, we don’t want the\ncompany to look like it was hiding that fact.\nGive creatives opportunities to Upskill: AI tools require new skills – prompt writing, iterative refinement, and\nbasic video editing to polish AI outputs. Invest in developing and onboarding tools so teams can begin learning how\nto effectively harness this technology.\nAlpha Projects: Choose a few of low-risk Alpha products to pursue. For example, create an internal training video\nseries using AI avatars, or generate supplemental social media content for a product campaign. Monitor how long it\ntakes, the quality feedback from viewers, and iterate. Use these pilots to build a case study: did it save money? Did\nit engage better (or worse)? What were the unforeseen hiccups? This builds institutional knowledge and also helps\njustify further investment to higher management.\nEthics and Authenticity: Review/revise our policy and approach to ethical AI use (if needed). For pharma especially,\npatient trust is key – avoid anything that could be seen as deceptive. If you use an AI avatar of a “doctor” in a\npatient video, maybe have a disclaimer like “Visuals are computer generated for illustration” if required. Also avoid\nsensitive contexts – e.g. generating a video of a real patient story would be unethical unless clearly fictionalized.\nKeep humans in the loop for empathetic or sensitive communications (AI can generate the draft, but let a human review\nthe tone).\nMonitor Regulatory and Legal Developments: Regulations around AI-generated content (so-called deepfake laws or\nrequired disclosures) are evolving globally. The EU, China, some US states have begun requiring disclosures for\ncertain AI-generated media. Ensure your compliance team keeps abreast of these so your use of AI video doesn’t run\nafoul of any new rule. For instance, if a law says “AI-generated realistic videos of humans must be labeled”, you’d\nincorporate that into your practice. Also, look to ongoing legal conflicts related to AI image generation to\nanticipate future issues with video generation.\nConsider a Long-term Strategy: Think how AI video fits into our digital transformation. This will not replace\neverything but could augment many processes. Consider organizing a center of excellence for generative media, pooling\nexpertise from IT, creative, legal. Long-term, also consider investing in custom model development for commercial\nneeds – e.g. partner with a vendor to fine-tune a model on Lilly video content (especially relevant for pharma with\nlots of scientific visuals). Owning or heavily customizing a model could give competitive edge, if it could generate\ncontent that is unique to Lilly IP and brand style, which others using generic models cannot.\nChallenges and Risks\n​\nWe’ve touched on several challenges in context, but let’s consolidate the major risks and challenges of AI video\ngeneration adoption:\nQuality and Consistency\n​\nWhile rapidly improving, AI-generated video can sometimes produce glitches – a person’s face warping for a frame, odd\nbackground artifacts, inconsistent lighting continuity, etc. In a professional setting, these can be jarring. Ensuring\nevery frame is clean might require frame-by-frame editing or re-generation cycles. There’s also the continuity over time\nissue – making sure the AI doesn’t “forget” what it was showing. Until models are truly robust, teams must budget time\nfor QC and maybe manually fixing AI output (via editing or inpainting tools).\nMisrepresentation and Deepfakes\n​\nAI can create very realistic fake people or events. In pharma, imagine an AI video of a “patient” giving a testimonial –\nif it’s not clearly fictional, that’s ethically problematic (real patient testimonials require consent and actual\npatient stories). Deepfakes of public figures endorsing a drug (even if done jokingly) would be bad. Lilly should set\nstrict lines: e.g. never impersonate real individuals or fabricate quotes without prior consent and compensation. The\nthreat of malicious deepfakes (outside actors using AI to create fake news about a company or fake exec statements) is\nalso real – another reason transparency and detection are important. On the flip side, we do not want Lilly to\naccidentally be accused of using a deepfake without disclosure.\nRegulatory Compliance\n​\nFor pharma, any promotional content must comply with FDA (or EMA, etc.) regulations. AI doesn’t change the requirement,\nbut it adds complexity to verification. If an AI video shows a patient using a drug, the visual could inadvertently\nbecome a “claim”. For example, if it shows the patient doing something that implies a benefit not on label, that’s a\ncompliance issue. Or if the AI inadvertently generates a medically inaccurate portrayal (like pills of wrong color or a\ndevice used incorrectly), that’s problematic. Thus, a deep integration of regulatory review is still needed – possibly\neven training the AI on what not to show. Regulators themselves may start scrutinizing AI-generated content differently;\ncompanies might need to provide more substantiation that the content is accurate and not misleading. There might even be\nfuture guidance specific to AI in pharma advertising.\nIntellectual Property and Training Data\n​\nA lingering question: if an AI video model was trained on, say, thousands of movie clips or YouTube videos without\npermission, is its output legally safe to use? The model developers claim yes, it’s transformative. But cases are in\ncourts (for images, Getty vs. Stability for e.g.). Using output commercially could pose IP risks if the output\nunintentionally replicates a copyrighted scene or character. While Adobe avoids this by training only on licensed data,\nothers might not. So one risk is the potential for a third-party claim: e.g. a background in an AI video looks too\nsimilar to a scene from a known film. The best mitigation is using providers who have clear training sources or\nindemnification. Or limiting use of AI for things where this risk is minimal (unique scenarios rather than known\ncharacters).\nEthical Considerations\n​\nBeyond legal compliance, ethical use concerns include: not reinforcing biases (if models were trained on biased content,\nthey might output stereotypes – careful prompting or model choice is needed to avoid, say, always depicting doctors as\none gender or certain roles in subservient ways, etc., which could slip into outputs unconsciously). Also, there’s\na human element – if marketing and comms become too AI-heavy, does it lose authenticity? We will have to find the right\nbalance between automation and human touch. And internally, treating employees openly about use of AI, offering\nre-skilling, etc., is important to maintain morale.\nTechnical Dependency and Evolution\n​\nIf a business builds processes around a third-party AI tool, they have to manage dependency risk. What if that service\nchanges pricing significantly, or a policy shift (e.g. an AI model decides to disallow certain medical content\ngeneration)? Executing a strategy that involves multiple options or maintaining the ability to switch models quickly is\nhighly advised. Also, file formats and integration: ensuring these AI outputs can integrate into existing video editing\nworkflows smoothly (most give MP4 outputs which is fine, but if you want something like masking info for overlays, not\nall provide that yet – Adobe likely will for theirs).\nSecurity and Privacy\n​\nPrompts and any input data sent to AI cloud services could contain sensitive info (especially if you’re generating\nsomething based on confidential product data or an unreleased device design). There’s the usual cloud risk – ensure the\nvendor has enterprise agreements if needed. Alternatively, do sensitive work on-prem with open models and sticking to\ngreen data for experimentation.\nPublic Perception\n​\nAs AI-generated content becomes more common, there may be public skepticism (“Is this video real or AI?”). If misused by\nbad actors, there could be a consumer backlash or calls for regulation. If we begin using it in consumer-facing ways\nshould be prepared to address questions about authenticity. Being on the honest, transparent side will guard brand\nreputation. For instance, if an AI is used to simulate a patient story, one might label it as a “dramatization” which is\na term already used in ads for reenactments. It’s about not breaking trust.\nIn summary, the opportunities and challenges are significant. They manageable with a proactive approach. The key is\nto not treat AI video as magic; it’s a powerful new tool that augments human creativity but still needs human oversight\nand strategic implementation.\nFuture Outlook\n​\nThe trajectory of AI video generation suggests that what is cutting-edge today could become commonplace and vastly more\ncapable in the next 2–3 years. Lilly should anticipate and prepare for the following likely developments:\nLonger & Real-Time Generation\n​\nModels will continue scaling (OpenAI hinted that bigger models = longer videos). We can expect by mid-2026 some AI\nsystems will routinely generate a few minutes of video with coherent storylines. There is even the possibility\nof real-time or streaming generation – imagine AI creating video on the fly as you watch (some research is headed there\nfor live avatar conversations, etc.). This could revolutionize live customer service (AI video agent responding in real\ntime) or live training sessions with dynamic visuals. While true real-time high-res generation might be a bit farther,\nreal-time at lower res may come sooner.\nImproved Fidelity\n​\nAlready Veo 3’s people are highly realistic; with more specialized training (and perhaps hybrid approaches like grafting\nAI-generated elements into real video backgrounds), AI videos will reach the point where an average viewer can’t tell AI\nvs real footage, at least for short sequences. This will blur the line of what content is “shot” vs “generated”. For\ncreators, that means tremendous creative freedom (any idea can be visualized without practical constraints) but also\ngreater need for ethical guidelines to maintain trust.\nInteractive Video & Multimodality\n​\nCombining video generation with interactivity (powered by LLMs like GPT-4/5) could yield interactive media. For example,\na user could talk to an AI character who responds with generated video and audio. This could be a new form of engaging\ncontent or education tool. In pharma, a patient could ask an AI “What will the surgery be like?” and get a custom visual\nexplanation video. We’re moving toward AI that can understand scene context deeply (Gemini is multimodal – it might\nalign narrative with visuals tightly). The merging of text, images, audio, and video AI means future tools will handle\nwhole multimedia generation. Google’s Flow already hints at that synergy (Gemini assisting with consistency across\nshots).\nIndustry-Specific Marketing Models/Tools\n​\nWe will likely see models fine-tuned for specific domains: e.g. a Medical VideoGen that knows how to accurately depict\nanatomy, or an Architectural VideoGen for real estate walkthroughs. These specialized models could be offered by\nvertical SaaS companies or open communities. For pharma, a model trained on, say, all publicly available MOA animations\nand medical footage could become the go-to for generating regulatory-compliant medical visuals (with knowledge of what\nnot to show because of how the body actually works).\nRegulatory Frameworks\n​\nGovernments and industry bodies will establish more formal guidelines. We might see something like an “AI Content\nCertification” where companies can submit AI-generated ads for a special review or to get a certification mark that it’s\nbeen vetted for accuracy. There’s also likely to be technology solutions for provenance: cryptographic signing of AI\ncontent so that it can be traced. OpenAI and Adobe already tag content; this could become standardized so that any\nscreen can potentially alert viewers “This video is AI-generated.” Lilly should anticipate that transparency may become\nnot just best practice but mandated.\nTalent and Workflow Shifts\n​\nRoles will shift – we might see “AI video prompt scriptwriters”, “AI ethics reviewers”, and “content curators” as common\njobs. Teams might reorganize such that an AI tool is part of every content meeting (e.g. brainstorm sessions always\ninvolve someone quickly prototyping ideas with AI to show the room). The speed of execution will increase, meaning\ncompetition in marketing might revolve around who can ideate and deploy creative concepts fastest (with AI doing the\nheavy lifting). The flip side is potential content glut – so focusing on strategy and creativity (the human part)\nremains vital to stand out.\nCompetitive Landscape\n​\nIt’s possible that only a few foundation models end up dominating (like we see in LLMs, a handful of leaders). But many\ncompanies might build on those via fine-tuning. We may see consolidation where big players acquire some startups\n(perhaps OpenAI buys a Pika, or Adobe buys an Runway, purely speculative). Or big tech might all have their offerings\nand split the market (like cloud providers). Keeping flexibility is wise –let’s not get too locked into since another\nwill likely surpass it. It could be analogous to the early days of web browsers or mobile OS – eventually a stable set\nof widely used platforms emerged. Likely a mix of open (Stability) and closed (OpenAI, Google) will persist, each with\npros and cons.\nNew Content Formats\n​\nAs AI lowers production costs, we might see entirely new forms of media. For instance, personalized short films as a\nservice (you input some info and get a short film about you). Or dynamic video content on websites that adjusts to\nviewer profile. In pharma, maybe dynamic visual aids for reps that change based on the doctor they’re speaking to (if\nthe doctor is more visual, the AI generates more mechanism animation; if they care about data, it shows charts, etc.,\nall in real time). The boundaries between video, animation, and software could blur.\nConclusion\n​\nIn conclusion, AI video generation is poised to become a standard tool in the content creation toolbox – much like\ndesktop publishing in the 80s or digital video editing in the 2000s. It will not outright replace humans, but those\nwho harness it effectively will outpace those who don’t, by producing more tailored and creative content with less\neffort. For the pharmaceutical industry and similar fields, the key will be to integrate these capabilities in a way\nthat enhances communication and understanding (of complex science, of patient stories) while maintaining the rigorous\nstandards of accuracy and ethics that the industry demands.\nLilly should take a proactive but careful approach: embrace the innovation, experiment with it, and begin with low-risk\nuse cases with some oversight eyeing the entire spectrum of use cases. By doing so, we can significantly boost its\ncontent innovation capacity and be ready for the future where AI-driven media is ubiquitous. The companies that succeed\nwill likely be those that combine the creative imagination of their teams with the generative power of AI, in a governed\nand purposeful manner – turning what used to be costly visual dreams into vivid (and responsible) reality.\nSources\n​\nVideo generation models as world simulators | OpenAI\nhttps://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/\n￼\nSora is here | OpenAI]\nhttps://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/\n￼\nRunway's Gen-2 shows the limitations of today's text-to-video tech | TechCrunch\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/runways-gen-2-shows-the-limitations-of-todays-text-to-video-tech/\nBest Short-Form AI Video Generator?

The TechHQ platform has evolved significantly with\nmajor additions to our AI architecture ecosystem, enhanced innovation pipeline framework, and expanded solution guide\nlibrary. Here's what's new this summer:\nThe highlight is the launch of our\nAI Architecture Ecosystem\n, authored by the EBA AI Architecture\nteam. This framework introduces a four-layer stack—Experience, AI, Model, and Data—along with reusable agentic AI\npatterns and memory architectures. We’ve also clarified our strategic AI platform positioning, with Cortex as our\nprimary GenAI platform.\nThe\nInnovation Pipeline\nis now easier to navigate thanks to a new Innovation Stage\nAssessment Table, helping teams define and assess the maturity of their work—from Pre-Alpha to General Release. Several\ncapabilities are currently in Pre-Alpha, including AI chatbot testing, automated test script generation, and mobile and\nA/V testing frameworks. We’ve also published our first Emerging Technologies write-up on AI video generation, comparing\nplatforms and outlining pharma-specific use cases.\nWe’ve expanded our\nSolution Guide Library\nwith new guides including Knowledge Sharing,\nData Visualization, and Document Processing. Each guide reflects our AI-first approach, with integrated recommendations\nfor tools like Microsoft Copilot, AI-powered test automation, and enhanced translation services. We’ve also improved\nlifecycle management\n.\nTo make all of this easier to explore, we’ve also made improvements to homepage navigation—so you can find what you need\nfaster. We’d love to hear what you think and what you'd like to see next.\nYour contributions\nand feedback help shape the\nfuture of TechHQ.\nTags:\nTech HQ\nEdit this page\nOlder post\nFebruary Updates Roll-up\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

A key principle of tool calling is that the model\ndecides when to use a tool based on the input's relevance.\nTool Binding\nWhat is 2 multiplied by 3?\nLLM with Tool Binding\nTool Definition\nPayload:\narguments: {'a':2, 'b':3}\ntool_name: multiply\ndef multiply(a,b):\nreturn a*b\nThis mechanism underpins modern agent frameworks by giving LLMs the ability to decide autonomously which tool to invoke\nand with what parameters, and even to chain multiple calls in service of complex tasks.\nFrom Tools to Agents\n​\nWhile tool calling provides LLMs with the ability to interact with external systems, agents represent a more\nsophisticated integration where these capabilities are combined with reasoning, planning, and autonomy. Agents leverage\ntool calling as a fundamental mechanism but extend it with additional capabilities.\n1.Natural language\n2.JSON call\n'function_name' + args\n3.Execute tool/api\n4.Return results\n5.Synthesize reply\nUser Prompt\nLLM (with function calling)\nDefined Functions/Tools\nFunction Executor\nFinal Response\nWhat Are Agents and Agentic Systems\nAgentic AI Systems\n​\nAgentic AI systems can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions and solve complex problems based on context and\nobjectives with minimal human supervision. These systems combine the flexibility of Gen-AI based reasoning (agents) with\nthe precision of traditional software engineering (tools) to plan, adapt and react.\nThe key components of agents are:\nAutonomy\n: Agents act independently within a defined scope, making their own decisions without continuous human\nintervention.\nGoal-Oriented\n: They break down high-level objectives into ordered sub-tasks, ensuring systematic progress toward\nspecific outcomes.\nTool Integration\n: Agents invoke external functions—APIs, databases, custom code—to execute real-world actions\nrather than just generate text.\nMemory & Context\n: By storing short- and long-term memories, they track past interactions and maintain continuity\nacross complex workflows.\nFeedback Loop\n: Agents evaluate the results of each action, learn from failures, and iteratively refine their\napproach using reinforcement learning or iterative planning.\nDecision-Making Framework\n: They employ reasoning strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought, rule-based logic) to choose\nwhich tools to use and how to sequence tasks for optimal performance.\nAction\nFeedback\nHuman\nLLM Call\nEnvironment\nStop\nBuilding Blocks of an Agentic System\n​\nAt the core of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with capabilities like retrieval, tools, and memory. These models can\nactively decide what to search, which tools to use, and what to remember. When implementing, focus on tailoring these\naugmentations to your use case and providing a clear, well-documented interface for your LLM.\nAgents and Workflows: Choosing the Right Approach\nThere is an important architectural distinction between workflows and agents:\nWorkflows\n: Systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths. The logic is hard-coded,\nand execution follows a fixed sequence.\nAgents\n: Systems where LLMs dynamically determine their own actions and tool usage. They maintain control over task\nexecution, deciding how to proceed based on goals and context.\nWhen to Use Workflows vs. Agents\n​\nWhen building LLM-powered applications, it's important to choose the simplest solution that meets your requirements.\nThis decision framework can help determine the appropriate approach:\nUse Workflows When:\n​\nTasks are well-defined with predictable steps\nConsistency and reliability are critical priorities\nYou need tight control over execution paths\nPerformance and latency requirements are strict\nCost efficiency is a primary concern\nThe problem space is well-understood and stable\nUse Agents When:\n​\nTasks require dynamic decision-making and adaptation\nProblems are complex with unpredictable paths to solutions\nFlexibility is more important than deterministic behavior\nThe environment or requirements change frequently\nTasks benefit from autonomous exploration of solutions\nMultiple tools need to be orchestrated based on context\nComplexity-Performance Tradeoff\n​\nAgentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance. This tradeoff should be carefully considered:\nStart Simple\n: For many applications, optimizing single LLM calls with retrieval and in-context examples is\nsufficient\nAdd Structure\n: When more control is needed, implement workflows with predefined paths\nIntroduce Agency\n: Only move to fully agentic systems when the benefits of flexibility and autonomous\ndecision-making outweigh the increased complexity, latency, and cost\nThe diagram below illustrates this progression from simple to complex approaches:\nLower complexity\nLower latency\nLower cost\nHigher flexibility\nBetter at complex tasks\nMore autonomous\nSimple LLM Calls\nwith Retrieval\nStructured\nWorkflows\nAutonomous\nAgents\nPerformance\nTradeoffs\nWorkflow Patterns and Future Directions\nUnderstanding Workflow Patterns\n​\nWorkflow patterns are specific, reusable architectural approaches that solve common orchestration challenges. These\npatterns have emerged from practical experience implementing LLM-based systems and provide proven templates for\ndifferent use cases.\nEach pattern offers distinct advantages for particular scenarios, with tradeoffs in complexity, flexibility, and\nperformance. Understanding these patterns helps developers select the most appropriate architecture for their specific\nrequirements.\nWorkflow: Prompt Chaining\n​\nWhat it is\n: Breaks a complex task into a linear sequence of LLM calls, where each step depends on the output of\nthe previous one. Optional checks (\"gates\") can be added to validate intermediate results before continuing.\nUse Case\n: Tasks that naturally decompose into smaller, ordered subtasks.\nGoal\n: Improve accuracy by simplifying each step (with increased latency).\nExamples\n:\nWrite marketing copy → translate it.\nDraft document outline → verify → write document.\nOutput 1\nPass\nFail\nOutput 2\nIn\nLLM Call 1\nGate\nLLM Call 2\nExit\nLLM Call 3\nOut\nWorkflow: Routing\n​\nWhat it is\n: An initial LLM (or classifier) decides what kind of input it's dealing with, then sends it to a\nspecialized follow-up process with tailored prompts, models, or tools.\nUse Case\n: Handling different input types that require different processing logic or prompts.\nGoal\n: Avoid one-size-fits-all prompts and optimize each case for performance.\nExamples\n:\nRoute support tickets by topic (refund, tech, billing).\nSend easy queries to small models, complex ones to powerful models.\nIn\nLLM Call Router\nLLM Call 1\nLLM Call 2\nLLM Call 3\nOut\nWorkflow: Parallelization\n​\nWhat it is\n: Executes multiple LLM tasks simultaneously. Two major types:\nSectioning\ndivides the task into parts that can be handled independently.\nVoting\nruns the same task multiple times to compare and combine outputs.\nUse Case\n: Tasks where subtasks are independent or benefit from diversity in answers.\nGoal\n: Reduce latency or improve quality through redundancy and diversity.\nExamples\n:\nSectioning\n: One model handles query; another filters for safety.\nVoting\n: Multiple LLMs review code or content and compare flags.\nIn\nLLM Call 2\nLLM Call 1\nLLM Call 3\nAggregator\nOut\nWorkflow: Orchestrator-Workers\n​\nWhat it is\n: A central LLM (the \"orchestrator\") dynamically analyzes the input, decides what subtasks are needed,\nand delegates each one to a \"worker\" LLM. The orchestrator then combines the results into a final answer.\nUse Case\n: Complex or open-ended tasks where required steps vary case by case.\nGoal\n: Introduce flexibility in how tasks are broken down and executed.\nExamples\n:\nModify code across multiple unpredictable files.\nAggregate and analyze info from multiple sources for research.\nIn\nOrchestrator\nLLM Call 1\nLLM Call 2\nLLM Call 3\nSynthesizer\nOut\nWorkflow: Evaluator-Optimizer\n​\nWhat it is\n: One LLM generates an initial output, and another LLM (or the same one in a different role) evaluates\nthat output and provides feedback or suggestions. This loop can repeat until the result meets defined quality\nstandards.\nUse Case\n: Tasks that benefit from refinement and where clear quality signals are available.\nGoal\n: Use iteration and self-critique to improve outputs.\nExamples\n:\nRefine literary translation based on nuance critiques.\nPerform multi-round research and validation for deeper coverage.\nSolution\nAccepted\nRejected + Feedback\nIn\nLLM Call Generator\nLLM Call Evaluator\nOut\nLooking Ahead: Agentic Patterns\n​\nWhile this article has focused primarily on workflow patterns, the agent side of the hierarchy deserves equal attention.\nIn our upcoming article \"Agentic Patterns,\" we will explore in depth the different types of agent architectures:\nSingle Agents\n: Autonomous systems that operate independently, using various reasoning and decision-making\nstrategies to accomplish tasks\nMulti-Agents\n: Collaborative systems where multiple agents work together, often specializing in different aspects\nof a problem\nThese agent patterns represent the next frontier in LLM applications, enabling even more sophisticated reasoning,\nplanning, and problem-solving capabilities. By understanding both workflow patterns and agent patterns, developers can\nmake informed decisions about which architectural approaches best suit their specific use cases.\nConceptual Hierarchy\nThe diagram below illustrates the conceptual hierarchy between tool calling, agents, and workflow patterns:\nTool Calling\nAgents\nWorkflows\nSingle Agents\nMulti Agents\nWorkflow Patterns\nPrompt Chaining\nRouting\nParallelization\nOrchestrator-Workers\nEvaluator-Optimizer\nReferences\nLangChain Tool Calling Concepts\nLangChain Workflow\nLangChain Tool Calling How-To\nOpenAI Function Calling Guide\nPrompting Guide: Function Calling\nAnthropic: Building Effective Agents\nLangGraph Multi-agent systems\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nagent-workflows\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nAgentic\nNext\nBuilding Agentic Patterns\nTool Calling\nFrom Tools to Agents\nAgentic AI Systems\nBuilding Blocks of an Agentic System\nWhen to Use Workflows vs. Agents\nUse Workflows When:\nUse Agents When:\nComplexity-Performance Tradeoff\nUnderstanding Workflow Patterns\nWorkflow: Prompt Chaining\nWorkflow: Routing\nWorkflow: Parallelization\nWorkflow: Orchestrator-Workers\nWorkflow: Evaluator-Optimizer\nLooking Ahead: Agentic Patterns\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

Context engineering is the art and science of filling the context window with just the right information at each step of an agent's trajectory.\nContext Engineering Overview\n​\nCore\nIsolate\nSplit Across Sub-agents\nSeparation of Concern\nCode Environment\nSeparation\nRuntime State Object\nCompress\nSummarizing\nRecursive/Hierarchical\nSummarization\nAgent to Agent\nSummarization\nTrimming\nRemove Older Messages\nFrom List\nSelect\nRead State Object/Scratchpad\nSelecting Memory\nPull Narrow Sets of File\nKnowledge Graph for\nMemory Indexing\nWrite\nScratchpad\nTool Calling\nWrite to scratchpad file\nRuntime State Object\nMemory\nSelf Generated Memories\nAcross Sessions\nContext Engineering\nWrite\nSelect\nCompress\nIsolate\nTypes of Context\n​\nContext engineering serves as an umbrella that applies across a few different context types:\nInstructions\n– prompts, memories, few-shot examples, tool descriptions, etc.\nKnowledge\n– facts, memories, etc.\nTools\n– feedback from tool calls\nContext Challenges\n​\nLong-running tasks and accumulating feedback from tool calls mean that agents often utilize a large number of tokens. This can degrade performance and opens up the door for hallucinations.\nStrategies for Agent Context Engineering\n​\nThese strategies can be categorized into 4 buckets:\nWrite\n– Saving context outside the context window to help an agent perform tasks\nSelect\n– Pulling relevant context into the context window when needed\nCompress\n– Retaining only the essential tokens required to perform tasks\nIsolate\n– Splitting context into separate components to optimize agent performance\nWrite\n​\nJust as humans take notes, agents can use \"scratchpads\" to persist information outside the context window. This approach saves critical information that remains accessible throughout task execution.\nImplementation Methods:\nSingle Session:\nFile-based storage\n– A tool call that writes information to a persistent file\nRuntime state\n– A field in a state object that persists during the session\nCross-Session:\n3.\nLong-term memory\n– Persistent storage that remembers information across multiple sessions (e.g., Windsurf, Cursor, ChatGPT)\nSelect\n​\nContext selection depends on how the scratchpad is implemented. If it's a tool, agents access it via tool calls. If it's part of the agent's runtime state, developers decide which parts of the state are exposed at each step, allowing more control over what context is visible during reasoning.\nMemory Usage\n​\nWhen agents have memory, they must also select which memories to use:\nEpisodic memories\nprovide few-shot examples of prior behavior.\nProcedural memories\nstore instructions to guide actions.\nSemantic memories\nstore factual knowledge relevant to tasks.\nSelecting the right memory improves performance and personalization.\nChallenges and Solutions\n​\nA key challenge is ensuring relevant memories are selected:\nMany code agents use fixed files (e.g.,\nCLAUDE.md\n,\nCursor's rules files\n) for consistent behavior.\nAgents with large memory stores (especially semantic memory) require advanced retrieval strategies.\nEmbeddings and knowledge graphs help with retrieval, but issues like irrelevant memory injection can still happen. For instance,\nChatGPT\nhas mistakenly inserted private user data into responses, raising concerns over context control and trust.\nCompress\n​\nAgent interactions can span hundreds of turns with token-heavy tool calls, requiring compression strategies to manage context efficiently.\nSummarization:\nUses LLMs to distill essential information from lengthy interactions\nClaude Code's\n\"auto-compact\" feature demonstrates this approach, summarizing full trajectories when context exceeds 95%\nCan employ recursive or hierarchical summarization strategies\nUseful for post-processing token-heavy tool calls (e.g., search results)\nApplied at agent-agent boundaries to reduce tokens during knowledge hand-off\nContext Trimming:\nFilters or \"prunes\" context using hard-coded heuristics rather than LLM processing\nExamples include removing older messages from conversation history\nMore deterministic than summarization but less intelligent about content relevance\nIsolate\n​\nContext isolation splits information across separate components to optimize agent performance.\nMulti-Agent:\nSplit context across sub-agents with specific tools and instructions\nOpenAI Swarm\nlibrary enables separation of concerns for specialized sub-tasks\nEach agent maintains its own context window\nSandboxed Environments:\nCode execution in isolated environments (e.g.,\nHuggingFace CodeAgent\n)\nSelected context from tool calls passed back to LLM\nPrevents context contamination between execution and reasoning\nState Objects:\nRuntime state schemas with selective field exposure\nContext written to specific fields, only relevant portions exposed to LLM\nEnables controlled context access without full sandboxing\nContext Engineering with LangGraph\n​\nWrite Context\n​\nLangGraph\nsupports short-term (thread-scoped) and long-term memory. Short-term memory uses checkpoints as a scratchpad, letting agents write and retrieve state across steps.\nSelect Context\n​\nAt each step, agents can:\nAccess short-term state\nto retrieve intermediate data\nQuery long-term memory\nusing different retrieval methods\nCompress Context\n​\nLangGraph\nlets you control context by passing a\nstate\nobject between nodes. A common method is using a message list and periodically\nsummarizing\nor\ntrimming it\nwith built-in tools.\nIsolate Context\n​\nLangGraph\nuses a structured\nstate\nobject where you define a schema. This lets you store tool outputs or other data in specific fields, keeping them isolated from the LLM until needed.\nReferences\n​\nContext Engineering for Agents\n- arXiv preprint.

REST uses URIs and JSON over HTTP, making it ideal for\ninteroperability but less suited for streaming or large payload efficiency.\ngRPC / Protocol Buffers\n– A fast, strongly-typed RPC system using HTTP/2 and binary Protobuf. Supports bidirectional\nstreaming and outperforms REST in high-throughput scenarios with auto-generated code across languages.\nGraphQL\n– A flexible query API that allows clients to request only needed data via a single endpoint. Best for\ncomplex, nested data models and diverse client needs.\nWebSockets / SSE\n– Real-time communication protocols. WebSockets enable two-way persistent connections, while SSE\nsupports one-way server-to-client streams. Useful for interactive or live-update applications.\nMessage Queues / Event Streams\n– Enable decoupled, asynchronous communication. MQTT is lightweight for IoT, while\nKafka and RabbitMQ support scalable, reliable pub/sub messaging across services.\nMainCategories\nAgentProtocols\nModel Context Protocol\nAgent-tool standard\nTool discovery\nStandardized interfaces\nAgent2Agent Protocol\nAgent-agent communication\nAgent discovery\nTask coordination\nAsyncProtocols\nWebSockets\nBi-directional streams\nPersistent connection\nReal-time updates\nMessage Queues\nDecoupled processing\nAsynchronous processing\nHigh scalability\nServer-Sent Events\nServer push updates\nSyncProtocols\nREST/HTTP\nSimple, ubiquitous\nStateless\nHuman-readable\ngRPC\nHigh-performance, streaming\nBinary encoding\nCode generation\nStreaming support\nGraphQL\nFlexible queries\nPrecise queries\nSingle endpoint\nCommunication Protocols\nSynchronous Protocols\nAsynchronous Protocols\nAgent-Specific Protocols\nEmerging Standards\n​\nThe W3C is actively developing two critical community groups focused on agent standardization:\nThe\nAutonomous Agents on the Web (WebAgents) Community Group\nfocuses on hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems that\nleverage Semantic Web standards.\nThe\nAI Agent Protocol Community Group\nis standardizing inter-agent communication protocols with PKI-based identity\nframeworks and cross-origin security mechanisms.\nThe IETF has introduced groundbreaking standards including:\nThe\nagent:// URI Protocol\nprovides a layered architecture supporting minimal to full-featured agent\nimplementations with the format:\nagent:[+<protocol>]://<authority>/<path>[?<query>][#<fragment>]\nThe\nAgent Name Service (ANS)\nspecification introduces DNS-inspired hierarchical agent addressing with PKI-based\ntrust.\nModern AI applications often mix these protocols. For example, many cloud AI tool APIs are offered as HTTPS/JSON\nservices (REST) for ease of integration, while high-performance backends might expose gRPC. In addition, AI-specific\nstandards are emerging: Anthropic's\nModel Context Protocol (MCP)\nand Google's\nAgent2Agent (A2A)\naim to\nstandardize agent–tool and agent–agent interfaces.\nAgent to Tool Communication\nModel Context Protocol (MCP)\n​\nOverview and Purpose\n​\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic, is a standardized JSON-based protocol that creates a universal\ninterface between AI models and tools. Acting as a \"USB-C port for AI,\" MCP enables any LLM to connect to any compliant\ntool or data source in a consistent way.\nMCP defines:\nHow tools describe their capabilities (functions, arguments, schemas)\nHow AI agents discover and invoke those functions\nHow responses (synchronous or streaming) are handled and returned\nThis standardization creates true interoperability between tools and models across vendors, allowing AI systems to query\ndatabases, call APIs, manipulate files, and access various services through a unified protocol.\nExternal Tool (MCP Server)\nAI Agent (MCP Client)\nApp or Orchestrator\nExternal Tool (MCP Server)\nAI Agent (MCP Client)\nApp or Orchestrator\nInstruction (e.g., \"Check calendar\")\nJSON Request via MCP\nResult or Event Stream\nFinal Output\nArchitecture and Components\n​\nMCP follows a client-host-server architecture with clearly defined roles:\nMCP Hosts\n: Applications like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or custom applications that initiate interactions\nMCP Clients\n: Protocol clients (typically AI models) that maintain connections with servers\nMCP Servers\n: Lightweight programs exposing specific capabilities through the standardized protocol\nData Sources\n: Local files/databases or remote services that MCP servers can securely access\nThis separation of concerns creates modular, composable systems where each server can focus on a specific domain (like\nfile access, web search, or database operations).\nInternet\nYour Computer\nMCP Protocol\nMCP Protocol\nMCP Protocol\nWeb APIs\nHost with MCP Client\n(Claude, IDEs, Tools)\nMCP Server A\nMCP Server B\nMCP Server C\nLocal\nData Source A\nLocal\nData Source B\nRemote\nService C\nCore Primitives\n​\nMCP defines three fundamental primitives that servers can implement:\nTools\n: Model-controlled functions that LLMs can invoke (like API calls, computations)\nExample: A calculator tool that performs mathematical operations\nImplementation: Functions with defined input/output schemas\nResources\n: Application-controlled data that provides context (like file contents, database records)\nExample: A document resource that provides access to text files\nImplementation: URI-addressable data sources with content types\nPrompts\n: User-controlled templates for LLM interactions\nExample: A summarization prompt template with configurable parameters\nImplementation: Parameterized prompt structures with variables\nFor most developers, tools are the most immediately useful primitive, allowing LLMs to perform actions programmatically.\nTransport Mechanisms\n​\nMCP supports two main transport mechanisms:\nStdio (Standard IO)\n:\nCommunication over standard input/output streams\nBest for local integrations on the same machine\nSimple setup with no network configuration\nIdeal for development and single-application integrations\nSSE (Server-Sent Events)\n:\nHTTP for client-to-server, SSE for server-to-client\nSuitable for remote connections across networks\nEnables distributed architectures\nRequired for remote accessibility\nRemote Deployment\nSSE Transport\nHTTP POST\n(client to server)\nSSE\n(server to client)\nMCP Client\nMCP Server\nLocal Deployment\nStdio Transport\nstdin/stdout\n(bidirectional)\nMCP Client\nMCP Server\nDevelopers familiar with FastAPI will find implementing MCP servers with SSE transport straightforward, as both use HTTP\nendpoints for receiving requests and support streaming responses using Server-Sent Events.\nBenefits and Ecosystem\n​\nThe true power of MCP lies in standardization rather than introducing new capabilities:\nReusability\n: Build a server once, use it with any MCP-compatible client\nComposability\n: Combine multiple servers to create complex capabilities\nEcosystem growth\n: Leverage servers created by others\nMCP has rapidly become the standard for LLM tool access with 150+ community servers and multi-language SDK support.\nImplementations use JSON-RPC or RESTful payloads with OAuth authentication, enabling diverse tool providers to connect\nto any MCP-compatible agent. For available servers, see the\nMCP GitHub repository\n.\nProtocol Comparison for Agent-Tool Communication\n​\nDifferent protocols offer different trade-offs:\nProtocol\nPros\nCons\nUse Cases\nWhen to Choose\nREST/HTTP\nSimple, ubiquitous\nStateless, no streaming\nGeneral tool calls\nFor broad compatibility and simple integrations\ngRPC\nBinary, efficient, supports streaming\nRequires stub generation\nHigh-performance backends\nFor performance-critical pipelines\nWebSockets\nBi-directional, persistent connections\nHarder to scale\nLive tool monitoring\nWhen real-time updates are needed\nGraphQL\nFlexible queries, single endpoint\nSchema complexity\nDynamic data needs\nWhen clients need precise control over data fetching\nMCP\nStandardized for agents, tool introspection\nEarly adoption\nAgent–tool abstraction layers\nFor standardized agent-tool workflows\nWhen comparing these, one key factor is state and streaming. gRPC and WebSockets allow keeping the \"conversation\" alive,\nwhich can reduce overhead for multiple back-and-forth messages. REST and GraphQL are inherently stateless (each call\nstands alone). Another factor is typing and validation: gRPC and GraphQL have strict schemas, whereas REST relies on\nad-hoc schemas that must be documented separately.\nUses\nUses\nUses\nUses\nAgent\nREST/HTTP\nSimple, ubiquitous\ngRPC\nHigh-performance\nWebSocket\nBi-directional\nMCP\nStandardized\nMCP Roadmap at Lilly\n​\nWith MCP as the foundation connecting development resources to agent tools and external systems for enterprise-wide AI\nintegration, organizations can streamline workflows, accelerate innovation, and ensure scalable, secure deployment\nacross their digital ecosystem.\nGitHub Template\n• Reference implementation\n• Protocol adapters\n• Documentation\nBackstage\n• Developer portal\n• API documentation\n• Service catalog\nTool Deployment\n• CATS, Kubed, and other\n• nodx -> dx support\n• URI-based access\nModel Context Protocol\n• Industry standards\n• Built-in Lilly auth\n• Multi-modal support\nCortex Toolkit\n• Unified SDK\n• Multiple protocol support\n• Developer resources\nCortex Agents\n• Tool integration\n• Agent orchestration\n• Observability and eval\nDiscovery\n• Tool exploration\n• Marketplace for discovery\nand configuration\nExternal Agents\n• Third-party integration\n• Cross-platform support\n• Standardized messaging\nSystem to System\nCompatibility\n• Cross-platform communication\n• Agent discovery\n• Capability negotiation\nAgent to Agent Communication\nAgent2Agent (A2A) Protocol\n​\nThe Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, developed by Google with over 50 industry partners, addresses a critical challenge in\nthe AI landscape: enabling AI agents built on diverse frameworks by different companies to communicate and collaborate\neffectively. A2A provides a common language for agents, fostering a more interconnected AI ecosystem.\nKey Components of an A2A Protocol\n​\nMessage Format\n: The structure of requests and responses. For example, each agent might produce or consume JSON\nthat follows a particular schema (such as an \"intents\" field, a \"metadata\" field, etc.).\nTransport Mechanism\n: How messages travel between agents. This could be over standard web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) or\nspecialized messaging buses (like gRPC or MQTT).\nDiscovery\n: How an agent finds other agents. This might be analogous to DNS in the internet world or a registry\nservice in the microservices world.\nSecurity and Authentication\n: Ensuring that only authorized agents can talk to each other, or that sensitive data\nis encrypted.\nKey Features and Capabilities\n​\nA2A enables agents to:\nDiscover capabilities\n: Agents can advertise their skills and find other agents with complementary abilities.\nNegotiate interaction modalities\n: Support for text, structured data, and media exchanges.\nCollaborate on tasks\n: Manage stateful, potentially long-running collaborative tasks.\nMaintain opacity\n: Agents can collaborate without exposing their internal state, memory, or proprietary tools.\nA2A is built on established standards:\nJSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S)\nfor standardized communication\nAgent Cards\nfor capability discovery and connection information\nFlexible interaction modes\nincluding synchronous request/response, streaming (SSE), and asynchronous notifications\nA2A and MCP: Complementary Protocols\n​\nA2A and MCP serve different but complementary roles in the agentic ecosystem:\nMCP (Model Context Protocol)\n: Connects agents to tools, APIs, and resources with structured inputs/outputs. It's\nhow agents access their capabilities.\nA2A (Agent2Agent Protocol)\n: Facilitates dynamic communication between different agents as peers. It's how agents\ncollaborate, delegate, and manage shared tasks.\nA2A Protocol\nMCP Protocol\nMCP Protocol\nUser\nAgent A\nAgent B\nTool 1\nTool 2\nHow A2A Works\n​\nA2A facilitates communication between a \"client\" agent and a \"remote\" agent through several key mechanisms:\nCapability Discovery\n: Agents advertise their capabilities using \"Agent Cards\" in JSON format, allowing client\nagents to identify the best agent for a task.\nTask Management\n: Communication is oriented around task completion. The task object has a defined lifecycle and\ncan be completed immediately or monitored over time for long-running operations.\nUser Experience Negotiation\n: Messages include \"parts\" with specified content types, allowing agents to negotiate\nthe correct format and explicitly include UI capabilities like iframes, video, or web forms.\nSecure Collaboration\n: A2A is designed with enterprise-grade authentication and authorization, supporting various\nauthentication schemes.\nAgent Cards\n​\nAgent Cards are JSON documents that serve as digital \"business cards\" for A2A Servers (remote agents). They are crucial\nfor discovery and initiating interaction, containing:\nIdentity\n: Name, description, and provider information\nService Endpoint\n: URL where the A2A service can be reached\nA2A Capabilities\n: Supported protocol features like streaming or push notifications\nAuthentication\n: Required authentication schemes (e.g., \"Bearer\", \"OAuth2\")\nSkills\n: List of specific tasks the agent can perform, including input/output modes and examples\nClient agents parse these cards to determine if a remote agent is suitable for a task, how to structure requests, and\nhow to communicate securely.\nSecurity Considerations\n​\nAgent Cards may contain sensitive information that should be protected:\nInternal service URLs\nAuthentication details (though storing actual secrets is discouraged)\nDescriptions of sensitive skills\nProtection mechanisms include access control on endpoints, mutual TLS, network restrictions, and authentication\nrequirements. Agent registries can implement selective disclosure, providing different levels of detail based on the\nclient's identity and permissions.\nThe Challenges of Agent Communication\n​\nWithout standardized protocols like A2A, organizations face several challenges:\nRedundant Work\n: Every time you add a new AI agent, you need to figure out how it speaks to the rest of your\necosystem, leading to redundant or \"copy-paste\" integration code.\nCompatibility Headaches\n: Suppose your NLP model runs on Python, and your knowledge graph is hosted in a Java-based\nmicroservice. Each might pass around data differently, making it hard for them to play nicely together.\nScaling Bottlenecks\n: As you incorporate more specialized agents (e.g., image recognition, forecasting, robotics),\nthe complexity explodes. Non-standardized communication turns into a big tangly mess, harming your ability to innovate\nquickly.\nBenefits of A2A\n​\nBreaking Down Silos\n: Connect agents across different ecosystems and frameworks.\nComplex Workflows\n: Enable agents to delegate sub-tasks, exchange information, and coordinate actions.\nInteroperability\n: Agents built on different platforms (LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, custom solutions) can\nwork together.\nModality Agnostic\n: Support for various communication modalities beyond text, including audio and video.\nA2A Design Principles\n​\nA2A follows five key design principles:\nEmbrace agentic capabilities\n: Focus on enabling collaboration between agents without requiring shared memory,\ntools, or context.\nBuild on existing standards\n: Leverage HTTP, SSE, and JSON-RPC for easier integration with existing IT\ninfrastructure.\nSecure by default\n: Support enterprise-grade authentication and authorization.\nSupport long-running tasks\n: Flexible design for quick tasks and deep research that may take hours or days.\nModality agnostic\n: Support various communication modalities beyond text.\nAgent2Agent Roadmap at Lilly\n​\ncoming soon!\nThe Future of Agent Interoperability\n​\nA2A has the potential to unlock a new era of agent interoperability, fostering innovation and creating more versatile\nagentic systems. The protocol is being developed collaboratively as open source, with industry partners working toward a\nproduction-ready version later this year.\nWhat's Next: Protocol Roadmap\n​\nA2A Protocol Roadmap\nAgent Discovery\nAuthorization schemes and\ncredentials in AgentCard\nAgent Collaboration\nQuerySkill method for\ndynamic capability checking\nTask Lifecycle & UX\nDynamic UX negotiation\nwith mid-task media support\nClient Methods & Transport\nClient-initiated methods and\nimproved streaming reliability\nReferences\ngRPC vs. REST | Postman Blog\nEssential Communication Protocols for Modern Software Architecture: REST, GraphQL, SOAP and More | Medium\nA2A and MCP: Start of the AI Agent Protocol Wars? - Koyeb\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) - Anthropic\nMCP connector - Anthropic\nAnnouncing the Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A) - Google Developers Blog\nSmythOS - Agent Communication Protocols: An Overview\nW3C Autonomous Agents on the Web Community Group\nIETF Agent URI Protocol Draft\nNIST Special Publication 800-207: Zero Trust Architecture\nAgent2Agent Protocol Documentation\nWas this helpful?\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nModel Foundry\nNext\nPositioning\nIndustry Standard Protocols\nEmerging Standards\nModel Context Protocol (MCP)\nOverview and Purpose\nArchitecture and Components\nCore Primitives\nTransport Mechanisms\nBenefits and Ecosystem\nProtocol Comparison for Agent-Tool Communication\nMCP Roadmap at Lilly\nAgent2Agent (A2A) Protocol\nKey Components of an A2A Protocol\nKey Features and Capabilities\nA2A and MCP: Complementary Protocols\nHow A2A Works\nAgent Cards\nThe Challenges of Agent Communication\nBenefits of A2A\nA2A Design Principles\nAgent2Agent Roadmap at Lilly\nThe Future of Agent Interoperability\nWhat's Next: Protocol Roadmap\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

While\nmaintaining our dual-cloud strategy with Azure and AWS as primary platforms, we recognize Google's specialized\ncapabilities in advanced AI and other unique business solutions. This document provides guidance on when and how Google\ntechnologies should be evaluated, adopted, and governed within our enterprise architecture.\nStrategic Positioning\n​\nAI Platform\n​\nWe are taking a cloud-agnostic approach to AI at Lilly, with Cortex as our main platform. For a complete view of our AI\nplatform positioning, refer our AI Positioning document. Approved platforms, such as Cortex, should be explored before\nconsidering Google AI capabilities.\nModel Approval Process\n: All AI models must be approved for specific use cases by the Advanced Intelligence team.

Organizations deploying LLMs face challenges ranging from version control chaos to unpredictable costs and quality assurance nightmares. This research examines the conceptual foundations and available solutions in the prompt management ecosystem, providing a comprehensive framework for tool selection.\nPrompt management information: Core concepts and infrastructure\n​\nModern prompt management systems have emerged as critical infrastructure for organizations deploying LLMs at scale. These systems function as\n\"git for prompts\"\nbut with additional features specifically designed for the unique challenges of language model applications. The fundamental problem they solve is prompt proliferation - without systematic management, prompts become scattered across codebases, documentation, and communication channels, creating accountability gaps and production risks.\nCore concepts of prompt management systems\n​\nA prompt management system provides\ncentralized storage and version control\nfor all prompts used across an organization. The key components include a prompt registry that serves as a single source of truth, a version control system that tracks changes over time, and a template engine supporting dynamic content injection. These systems implement\ndecoupled architecture\npatterns, separating prompt content from application logic to enable non-technical stakeholders to modify prompts without code changes.\nThe architectural foundation typically includes\nclient-side caching\nto eliminate latency impact, with platforms like Langfuse implementing asynchronous cache refreshing for optimal performance. This design pattern allows teams to iterate rapidly on prompts while maintaining production stability. The separation of concerns also enables environment-specific configurations, allowing different prompt versions for development, staging, and production environments.\nPrompt versioning and lifecycle management\n​\nEffective versioning strategies follow\nsemantic versioning principles\n(X.Y.Z format), where major versions indicate breaking changes, minor versions represent new features maintaining compatibility, and patches address bug fixes. Modern systems implement branching strategies similar to software development, with environment-based branches for different deployment stages and feature branches for experimental variations.\nThe prompt lifecycle encompasses six distinct phases:\nplanning and design\n, where teams define success criteria and target audiences;\ndevelopment\n, involving initial creation and iteration;\ntesting and validation\nthrough rigorous evaluation;\noptimization\nbased on performance metrics;\nrelease and deployment\nwith comprehensive documentation; and\nmaintenance\nthrough continuous monitoring and adaptation. Each phase requires specific tooling and processes to ensure quality and reliability.\nDeployment strategies have evolved to include\nlabel-based deployment\nmechanisms, where prompts are tagged as production, staging, or latest. Advanced platforms support gradual rollout mechanisms including blue-green deployments for instant switching between versions, canary releases for subset testing, and feature flags for user segment targeting.\nTemplate management and parameterization\n​\nTemplate systems form the backbone of dynamic prompt generation, with various syntax options including\nF-string format\nfor Python-style variable injection,\nJinja2 templates\nfor complex logic,\nMustache templates\nfor cross-language compatibility, and proprietary formats like Anthropic's double bracket notation. These systems support static variables for consistent elements, function-based variables for runtime content generation, and contextual variables that adapt based on user attributes or business rules.\nAdvanced template features include\nconditional logic\nfor dynamic content paths,\nnested templates\nenabling composition and inheritance, and\nmodular architectures\nthat reduce duplication. Security considerations are paramount, requiring input sanitization to prevent template injection attacks and secure handling of sensitive data within templates.\nCollaboration features for teams\n​\nModern prompt management systems recognize that effective prompt engineering requires\ncross-functional collaboration\n. Role-based access control (RBAC) systems define clear permissions for prompt engineers who create and optimize prompts, domain experts who provide business context, developers who handle technical integration, and product managers who coordinate requirements.\nMulti-stage approval workflows\nensure quality control through draft, review, approval, and deployment stages. Each stage involves different stakeholders, from informal team reviews during drafting to formal compliance checks before production deployment. Real-time collaboration features include simultaneous editing capabilities, comment systems for asynchronous feedback, and integration with communication platforms like Slack for notifications.\nPrompt evaluation information: Methods and metrics for quality assurance\n​\nThe evaluation of LLM outputs represents one of the most challenging aspects of AI deployment. Unlike traditional software where outputs are deterministic, LLMs produce varied responses that require sophisticated evaluation frameworks combining automated metrics, human judgment, and statistical analysis.\nDifferent types of prompt evaluation methods\n​\nTraditional NLP metrics\nlike BLEU and ROUGE provide baseline measurements through n-gram overlap analysis. BLEU measures precision-based similarity using a brevity penalty to prevent gaming through short outputs, while ROUGE focuses on recall, making it particularly effective for summarization tasks. However, these metrics show\npoor correlation with human judgment\nfor creative or conversational tasks.\nModern evaluation approaches leverage\nmodel-based metrics\nsuch as BERTScore, which uses contextual embeddings to capture semantic relationships beyond surface-level text matching. Task-specific metrics have emerged to address particular concerns: faithfulness metrics ensure outputs are grounded in provided context, relevance scores measure alignment with input queries, and specialized detectors identify toxicity, bias, and safety violations.\nLLM-as-a-judge\napproaches represent a paradigm shift in evaluation methodology. These systems use one language model to evaluate outputs from another, implementing various patterns including single output scoring (with or without references) and pairwise comparison. Research indicates these approaches achieve approximately\n80% agreement with human evaluators\n, with GPT-4 showing the highest correlation (Spearman's ρ = 0.67 for correctness assessments).\nAutomated evaluation vs human evaluation\n​\nThe choice between automated and human evaluation involves fundamental tradeoffs.\nAutomated evaluation\noffers unlimited scalability, processing thousands of examples at minimal cost while maintaining perfect consistency. However, it struggles with nuanced understanding, creative assessment, and cultural context. These systems excel at high-volume production monitoring, regression testing, and initial quality screening for objective tasks.\nHuman evaluation\nprovides irreplaceable value through nuanced understanding of context, creativity assessment, and ethical considerations. Human evaluators can identify subtle quality issues that automated systems miss, understand cultural sensitivities, and evaluate complex multi-step reasoning. The primary limitations are scalability constraints, inter-annotator disagreement reaching 20-30% for subjective tasks, and the significant time and cost requirements.\nIndustry best practices increasingly favor\nhybrid approaches\nthat leverage the strengths of both methods. A typical implementation uses automated screening for 95% of outputs, escalating edge cases and high-importance scenarios to human review. This tiered system begins with basic automated checks, progresses to LLM-as-judge evaluation for sophisticated assessment, and reserves human verification for critical decisions.\nMetrics and scoring systems\n​\nEvaluation frameworks must consider multiple dimensions of quality.\nTraditional metrics\nremain relevant for specific use cases - BLEU scores work well for translation tasks, while perplexity measurements help assess language modeling capability. However, their limitations have driven adoption of more sophisticated approaches.\nCustom metrics development\nhas become essential for domain-specific applications. Organizations develop metrics for cultural sensitivity in global applications, technical accuracy in specialized domains like medicine or law, and brand voice alignment for customer-facing content. The implementation framework involves defining specific success criteria, creating representative evaluation datasets, developing clear scoring rubrics, validating metrics against human judgment, and iterating based on production performance.\nThe emergence of\nmulti-criteria evaluation\nrecognizes that prompt quality cannot be captured by single metrics. Modern platforms enable combining multiple evaluation methods, weighting different criteria based on use case requirements, and creating composite scores that reflect overall quality.\nA/B testing methodologies for prompts\n​\nRigorous A/B testing requires\nstatistical foundations\nincluding appropriate sample size calculations, effect size determination, and statistical power considerations. The standard approach targets 95% confidence levels (p < 0.05) with 80% statistical power to detect meaningful differences. Sample size calculations must account for expected conversion rates and minimum detectable effects.\nTest design best practices\nemphasize randomization to eliminate selection bias, stratification to account for user segments, and temporal control spanning complete business cycles. Tests should run for minimum seven days to capture weekly patterns, with longer durations for B2B applications that follow monthly cycles. Concurrent testing of variants controls for external factors that might influence results.\nThe implementation framework progresses through\nhypothesis formation\n, where teams define null and alternative hypotheses with specific success criteria;\ntest execution\nwith random assignment and continuous monitoring; and\nanalysis and interpretation\nconsidering both statistical and practical significance. Organizations must analyze results across user segments and document findings for future reference.\nDeployment and UI information: From development to production scale\n​\nThe deployment of prompt management systems requires sophisticated infrastructure supporting everything from local development to global production scale. Modern architectures emphasize API-first design, comprehensive monitoring, and user interfaces that accommodate both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\nAPI deployment options\n​\nREST API patterns\ndominate the landscape with standard endpoints for CRUD operations on prompts, streaming endpoints using Server-Sent Events for real-time responses, and batch processing capabilities for high-volume operations. Best practices include semantic versioning in URL paths, backward compatibility through additive changes, and comprehensive pagination for large prompt libraries.\nGraphQL implementations\noffer advantages through single endpoints serving all operations, flexible data fetching that reduces over-fetching, and real-time subscriptions for prompt updates. The introspection capabilities enable dynamic schema discovery, supporting more flexible client implementations. However, the added complexity may not be justified for simpler use cases.\nStreaming architectures\nhave become essential for real-time applications. HTTP/2 Server Push enables efficient real-time delivery, WebSocket connections support bidirectional communication for interactive applications, and event-driven architectures using message queues handle high-throughput scenarios. Implementation requires careful attention to backpressure handling, connection pooling, and automatic reconnection mechanisms.\nVersioning strategies\nmust balance stability with evolution. URI path versioning (/api/v1/ vs /api/v2/) offers clarity but requires careful URL management. Header-based versioning provides cleaner URLs while maintaining version control. Migration best practices include maintaining 2-3 major versions concurrently, implementing feature flags for gradual rollouts, and providing 6-12 month deprecation notices.\nIntegration patterns with existing systems\n​\nSDK design patterns\nemphasize consistency across programming languages while providing language-specific optimizations. Modern SDKs implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff, built-in instrumentation for observability, and async/await support for non-blocking operations. The architecture should maintain consistent API surfaces while leveraging language-specific features for optimal developer experience.\nMiddleware patterns\nenable seamless integration with existing applications. Request/response middleware handles cross-cutting concerns including authentication, rate limiting, caching, and logging. These patterns support gradual adoption, allowing teams to integrate prompt management without wholesale application rewrites.\nOrchestration patterns\nbecome critical for complex workflows. Platforms like Apache Airflow and Kubeflow provide DAG-based workflow management, while newer solutions support agent-based orchestration for dynamic routing. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables standardized tool-use coordination across different agent frameworks.\nUser interface design for prompt management\n​\nEffective UI design must balance power with usability.\nCore patterns\ninclude Monaco Editor integration for syntax-highlighted prompt editing, variable injection with auto-completion, real-time template preview, and side-by-side version comparison. These features must be accessible to non-technical users while providing advanced capabilities for power users.\nThe\nprompt development lifecycle\nfollows a clear workflow from creation through testing, versioning, deployment, monitoring, and iteration. User experience patterns emphasize progressive disclosure, starting with simple interfaces and revealing advanced features as needed. Collaborative editing with real-time updates and conflict resolution enables team-based development.\nEvaluation and testing interfaces\nrequire special attention. Batch testing capabilities allow uploading datasets for comprehensive evaluation, while interactive playgrounds enable real-time experimentation. Comparison views showing multiple models or prompts side-by-side facilitate decision-making, supported by metrics dashboards visualizing performance trends.\nMonitoring and observability features\n​\nStructured logging\nforms the foundation of effective monitoring. Logs must capture timestamp, trace and span IDs for correlation, prompt and execution identifiers, detailed metrics including token usage and latency, and evaluation scores. This structured approach enables sophisticated analysis while maintaining human readability.\nDistributed tracing\nprovides end-to-end visibility across complex LLM pipelines. OpenTelemetry integration has emerged as the standard, enabling vendor-neutral instrumentation. Tracing must capture prompt execution flows, identify performance bottlenecks, track error propagation, and attribute costs per request and user.\nMetrics and KPIs\nspan technical and business dimensions. Technical metrics include latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99), token usage and associated costs, error rates by type, and throughput measurements. Quality metrics track accuracy scores, user feedback ratings, hallucination detection rates, and safety compliance. Business metrics focus on user engagement, cost efficiency, and performance trends over time.\nAlerting and incident response\nsystems categorize issues by severity. Performance alerts trigger on latency or error rate thresholds, cost alerts prevent budget overruns, quality alerts detect accuracy degradation, and infrastructure alerts ensure system availability. Platform implementations like Datadog LLM Observability provide end-to-end tracing with built-in security scanners, while open-source alternatives like Langfuse offer similar capabilities without vendor lock-in.\nComprehensive tool analysis\n​\nThe prompt management ecosystem has evolved rapidly, with tools ranging from open-source projects to enterprise platforms. Each tool addresses specific aspects of the prompt lifecycle, from development and testing to deployment and monitoring.\nMicrosoft PromptFlow and MLflow\n​\nMicrosoft PromptFlow\nprovides a visual, flow-based approach to LLM application development. The platform offers a DAG-based visual interface where users can create standard flows for general applications, chat flows for conversational apps, and evaluation flows for assessment scenarios. While the\ncore platform is open source\n(MIT license), costs arise from underlying Azure services, typically running $50+ per day for moderate usage.\nThe platform excels in enterprise scenarios with full\nAzure RBAC integration\nand built-in roles for different user types. However, collaboration features remain limited, requiring a \"clone\" workflow for multi-user editing. The visual development paradigm makes it accessible to non-technical users while maintaining the power needed for complex applications.\nMLflow\nhas evolved into a comprehensive platform for both traditional ML and LLM applications. The\n3.0 release\nintroduced significant GenAI capabilities including a git-inspired prompt registry with commit-based versioning, enhanced LLM tracking, and sophisticated evaluation frameworks. The platform remains\ncompletely free\nas open source, though Databricks offers managed enterprise features.\nMLflow's strength lies in its\nmature ecosystem\nand provider-agnostic approach. The LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework provides built-in metrics for toxicity, correctness, and relevance, while supporting custom evaluators. The unified interface works across OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers, making it ideal for organizations using multiple LLM services.\nLangSmith and Weights & Biases Prompts\n​\nLangSmith\nrepresents a purpose-built solution for LLM observability and prompt engineering. The platform offers comprehensive prompt versioning with git-like controls, an interactive prompt canvas for optimization, and advanced tracing capabilities.

The evaluation framework combines LLM-as-judge capabilities with human feedback collection, enabling sophisticated quality assurance workflows. Zero-latency observability ensures production applications aren't impacted by monitoring overhead.\nWeights & Biases Prompts/Weave\nextends the established W&B MLOps platform into LLM territory. The unified platform approach allows teams to manage traditional ML and LLM experiments in one place. However, the\npricing model\nhas drawn criticism, with enterprise costs reported at $200-400/user/month and a \"tracked hours\" model that can become expensive for parallel workloads.\nThe platform excels in\nvisualization and reporting\n, leveraging W&B's mature dashboarding capabilities. Integration with the broader W&B ecosystem provides advantages for teams already using the platform for traditional ML workflows, though the complexity may overwhelm teams focused solely on LLM applications.\nHumanloop and Promptfoo\n​\nHumanloop\npositions itself as an enterprise-grade AI evaluation platform with strong collaborative features. The platform emphasizes\nhuman-in-the-loop\nworkflows, enabling domain experts to participate in prompt engineering without technical expertise.

Specialized tools like Promptfoo and OpenLLMetry excel in specific areas - security testing and observability respectively. Enterprise platforms like Humanloop and LangSmith offer compliance, collaboration, and scale for large organizations.\nCost considerations\nvary dramatically across solutions. Open-source tools provide the lowest total cost of ownership for teams with technical expertise, while managed platforms trade higher costs for reduced operational overhead. The W&B \"tracked hours\" model and Azure service dependencies can create unexpectedly high costs at scale.\nTechnical architecture\nchoices have long-term implications. Vendor-neutral approaches using OpenTelemetry provide flexibility and prevent lock-in, while integrated platforms offer faster time-to-value. Organizations must balance immediate productivity gains against future flexibility needs.\nThe\ncollaboration dimension\nincreasingly determines platform success. Tools enabling non-technical stakeholder participation see higher adoption rates and better prompt quality through domain expert involvement. However, technical teams may prefer CLI-first tools that integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows.\nSelection criteria\nshould prioritize your organization's specific context. Start-ups benefit from free tiers and open-source solutions, while enterprises require compliance certifications and dedicated support. Consider your team's technical sophistication, existing tool investments, and scaling requirements when making decisions.\nThe prompt management ecosystem continues evolving rapidly, with new tools emerging monthly and existing platforms adding capabilities. Organizations should design their architecture to accommodate change, using abstraction layers and standard protocols where possible. Success requires not just tool selection but also process design, team training, and continuous optimization based on production metrics.\nWas this helpful?\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nPlatforms\nNext\nExamples\nPrompt management information: Core concepts and infrastructure\nCore concepts of prompt management systems\nPrompt versioning and lifecycle management\nTemplate management and parameterization\nCollaboration features for teams\nPrompt evaluation information: Methods and metrics for quality assurance\nDifferent types of prompt evaluation methods\nAutomated evaluation vs human evaluation\nMetrics and scoring systems\nA/B testing methodologies for prompts\nDeployment and UI information: From development to production scale\nAPI deployment options\nIntegration patterns with existing systems\nUser interface design for prompt management\nMonitoring and observability features\nComprehensive tool analysis\nMicrosoft PromptFlow and MLflow\nLangSmith and Weights & Biases Prompts\nHumanloop and Promptfoo\nOpen source ecosystem\nFeature comparison chart\nKey insights for decision-making\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

Its primary purpose is to answer questions and generate briefing documents for key stakeholders using standard Eli Lilly language and style. The system employs a sophisticated agentic architecture that coordinates multiple specialized AI agents working together to conduct comprehensive research and produce high-quality content.\nPRM addresses a critical need in corporate communications: conducting thorough research and generating media briefing documents for executives that ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistent messaging. By automating this process through an agentic approach, PRM significantly reduces the time and effort required while maintaining high standards of quality and consistency.\nSystem Architecture Overview\n​\nTools\nAgents\nUI Components\nExternal Data Sources\nNews Journals\\n(NYT, WP, WSJ, etc.)\nWeb Search\\n(DDG, Bing)\nYouTube Transcriptions\nWikipedia\nInternal Data Sources\nLilly Press Release\nEarnings Call Transcripts\nPrior Briefing Documents\nResearch Topic\nResearch Factors\nHuman Interaction\nBriefing Document\nResearch Planner\\nContextualization Agent\nResearcher\\nResearch Agent (CoT / ToT)\nSynthesizer\\nInterview / Q&A Agent\nCopyeditor\\nFormatting Agent\nRAG\nWeb Search\nYouTube\nWikipedia\nThe diagram above illustrates the architecture of the Press Release Miner system, showing how UI components, specialized agents, tools, and data sources interact to create a comprehensive research and content generation pipeline.\nThe PRM Process\n​\nThe Press Release Miner follows a structured six-step process to generate comprehensive briefing documents:\nDevelop a research plan\n: The system begins by analyzing the research topic and developing a strategic plan for gathering information. This includes identifying key factors and questions that need to be addressed.\nSearch internal press releases\n: PRM leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to search through Eli Lilly's internal press releases, extracting relevant information and insights.\nSearch web for news sources\n: The system extends its research to external sources, searching trusted news outlets and websites for additional context and information.\nConduct follow-up research\n: Based on initial findings, PRM performs deeper, targeted research to fill knowledge gaps and answer specific questions that arise.\nSynthesize research results\n: The system integrates information from multiple sources, removing duplicates and organizing content into a coherent structure with proper citations.\nGenerate briefing document\n: Finally, PRM produces a well-formatted briefing document that adheres to Eli Lilly's language and style guidelines.\nThis entire process is orchestrated through approximately 50 LLM calls, distributed across various agents and tools within the system.\nSystem Architecture\n​\nPRM's architecture consists of four main components: UI interfaces, specialized agents, tools, and data sources. These components work together to create a seamless research and content generation pipeline.\nUI Components\n​\nResearch Topic\n: Interface for users to input the main subject for research\nResearch Factors\n: Display and selection of key aspects to investigate\nHuman Interaction\n: Interface for user feedback and guidance during the research process\nBriefing Document\n: Final output display with the generated content\nAgents\n​\nPRM employs four specialized agents, each with distinct responsibilities:\nResearch Planner (Contextualization Agent)\n: Responsible for understanding the research topic, breaking it down into manageable components, and developing a comprehensive research strategy. This agent provides the overall direction for the research process.\nResearcher (Research Agent/CoT/ToT)\n: The primary information gathering agent that executes the research plan. It utilizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning to conduct thorough investigations across multiple sources.\nSynthesizer (Interview/Q&A Agent)\n: Processes and integrates the collected information, identifying patterns, resolving contradictions, and organizing content into a coherent narrative. This agent can also generate follow-up questions to fill information gaps.\nCopyeditor (Formatting Agent)\n: Ensures the final document adheres to Eli Lilly's style guidelines, maintains consistent formatting, and includes proper citations for all information sources.\nTools\n​\nThe agents leverage several tools to perform their tasks:\nRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n: Enables semantic search across internal documents, retrieving relevant information based on context rather than just keywords.\nWeb Search\n: Interfaces with search engines (primarily Bing) to gather information from trusted external sources.\nYouTube\n: Extracts information from video content, particularly from news channels and official company presentations.\nWikipedia\n: Provides background information and context for topics and entities mentioned in the research.\nData Sources\n​\nPRM accesses both internal and external data sources:\nInternal Data Sources\n:\nLilly Press Releases\nEarnings Call Transcripts\nPrior Briefing Documents\nExternal Data Sources\n:\nNews Journals (NYT, WP, WSJ, etc.)\nWeb Search Results (DDG, Bing)\nYouTube Transcriptions\nWikipedia\nAgentic Patterns in PRM\n​\nThe Press Release Miner implements several sophisticated agentic patterns that enable effective coordination, parallel processing, and specialized task execution. These patterns represent the cutting edge of multi-agent system design and contribute significantly to PRM's effectiveness.\nMulti-Agent Coordination\n​\nPRM's architecture demonstrates how multiple specialized agents can work together to accomplish complex tasks. The system implements a coordination mechanism that allows agents to:\nShare context\n: Agents pass information and context to each other, ensuring continuity throughout the research process.\nSequential processing\n: The Research Planner sets the direction, followed by the Researcher gathering information, the Synthesizer integrating it, and finally the Copyeditor formatting the output.\nFeedback loops\n: Agents can request additional information or clarification from other agents when needed, creating a dynamic research process.\nThis coordination pattern enables each agent to focus on its specialized task while contributing to the overall goal of producing a comprehensive briefing document.\nTool Usage Patterns\n​\nPRM implements three distinct tool usage patterns across its agents:\nTool Calling Pattern\n: The system uses a structured approach for agents to invoke tools, with clear input/output specifications. This pattern is implemented in\ntool_calling_tool.py\n, which creates a runnable agent that can use multiple tools based on a system template and human instructions.\nfunction tool_calling_runnable(tool_runtime):\nInitialize system template from tool_runtime\nCopy and initialize tools from tool_runtime\nFor each tool:\nAdd tool name and description to system template\nCreate prompt template with system template, human template, and agent scratchpad\nCreate tool-calling agent with LLM, tools, and prompt\nReturn agent executor with configured agent and tools\nReAct Pattern (Reasoning and Acting)\n: PRM implements the ReAct pattern in\nreact_tool.py\n, allowing agents to alternate between reasoning about their next steps and taking actions. This pattern enhances the agent's ability to plan and execute complex research tasks.\nfunction react_agent_runnable(tool_runtime):\nCopy and initialize tools from tool_runtime\nCreate prompt from react template\nCreate ReAct agent with LLM, tools, and prompt\nReturn agent executor with configured agent and tools\nSelf-Ask Pattern\n: Implemented in\nself_ask_tool.py\n, this pattern enables agents to break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions, answer them sequentially, and then synthesize a final answer. This is particularly useful for complex research topics that require multi-step reasoning.\nfunction self_ask_runnable(tool_runtime):\nCopy tools from tool_runtime\nSelect first tool and rename it to \"Intermediate Answer\"\nCreate prompt from self-ask template\nCreate self-ask agent with LLM, tool, and prompt\nReturn agent executor with configured agent and tool\nParallel Processing\n​\nOne of PRM's most powerful features is its ability to conduct research on multiple topics or factors simultaneously. This is implemented through the\nparallelization_tool.py\n, which enables:\nConcurrent tool execution\n: Multiple tools can be executed in parallel across different research topics.\nAsynchronous processing\n: The system uses Python's asyncio to manage concurrent tasks efficiently.\nResult aggregation\n: Results from parallel processes are collected and integrated into a coherent output.\nasync function async_parallel_tool_call(topics, tool_runtime, id_task, target):\nCreate queue for communication\nCreate empty tasks list\nFor each topic:\nCreate async task for processing topic and add to tasks list\nWhile true:\nGet item from queue\nYield item to caller\nMark task as done\nIf all tasks are done and queue is empty:\nBreak loop\nAwait all tasks to complete\nThis parallel processing capability significantly reduces the time required to conduct comprehensive research across multiple topics or factors.\nAgent Specialization and Collaboration\n​\nPRM demonstrates how specialized agents can collaborate effectively to produce high-quality outputs. Each agent has a specific role:\nResearch Pipeline Agent\n: Orchestrates the overall research process, managing the flow of information between other agents and tools.\nclass ResearchPipeline:\nfunction __init__(llm, bing_subscription_key, retriever, templates, etc):\nStore all parameters as instance variables\nInitialize tools array with web search, RAG, and other tools\nCreate dictionary of agent runnables (simple, react, self-ask)\nInitialize tool runtime configuration\nasync function research_question(target, agent_type):\nSelect appropriate agent type\nFor each event from parallel tool execution:\nYield event to caller\nasync function research_question_with_factors(target, topics, format_section_prompt, remove_duplicates_prompt, agent_type):\nSelect appropriate agent type\nProcess research results in parallel\nFormat and deduplicate results\nYield final output\nFormatting Agent\n: Specializes in ensuring consistent formatting and removing duplicates across research outputs.\nclass FormatResearchAgent:\nfunction __init__(llm):\nStore LLM as instance variable\nasync function async_format_section(research_output, format_section_prompt):\nFind reference text with maximum length\nCreate formatting instruction with reference and candidate texts\nCreate formatting chain with LLM\nProcess each research output for uniform formatting\nReturn formatted outputs\nasync function async_remove_duplicates(research_output, remove_duplicates_prompt):\nCreate deduplication instruction template\nCreate deduplication chain with LLM\nCompare each pair of research outputs\nRemove duplicate information\nReturn deduplicated outputs\nBrainstorming Agent\n: Generates research factors and questions to guide the research process.\nfunction brainstorming_agent(brainstorming_prompt_template, llm):\nCreate prompt template with target variable and max 5 items limit\nCreate LLM chain with prompt and LLM\nReturn the chain for generating research factors\nThis specialization allows each agent to focus on what it does best while contributing to the overall system goal.\nTechnical Implementation\n​\nLLM Integration\n​\nPRM integrates with Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model to power its agents. The system makes approximately 50 LLM calls throughout the research and content generation process, distributed across various agents and tasks. The LLM integration is managed through a custom model class that handles authentication and API interactions with Azure OpenAI services and AWS resources.\nTechnologies Used\n​\nPRM leverages several key technologies:\nLangChain\n: Used extensively for agent creation, tool integration, and prompt management. LangChain provides the foundation for the agentic patterns implemented in PRM.\nFastAPI\n: Powers the backend API, providing WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication during the research process.\nFAISS\n: Implements the vector store for efficient semantic search across internal documents.\nAzure OpenAI\n: Provides the LLM capabilities that power the agents' reasoning and content generation.\nBing Search API\n: Enables web search functionality for gathering information from external sources.\nPrompt Engineering\n​\nPrompt engineering is a critical aspect of PRM's implementation. The system uses carefully crafted prompts to guide each agent's behavior and ensure high-quality outputs. For example:\nResearch Agent Prompt\n: Guides the research process with specific instructions for gathering comprehensive information:\n# The research agent prompt instructs the agent to gather detailed information with proper citations, format responses with chronological ordering and bulleted lists, and ensure all facts are properly attributed to their sources.\nFormatting Agent Prompt\n: Ensures consistent formatting and structure across research outputs:\n# The formatting agent prompt guides the agent to combine research outputs from multiple sources into a cohesive document, maintain proper citations for all facts and figures, and structure the content with appropriate headings and subheadings.\nDe-duplication Prompt\n: Removes redundant information across research outputs:\n# The de-duplication prompt instructs the agent to compare reference and candidate texts, remove duplicate facts, quotes, and figures from the candidate text, and ensure the final output has no redundant information while maintaining coherent flow.\nThese prompts are critical for guiding the agents' behavior and ensuring they produce outputs that meet Eli Lilly's standards for quality and consistency.\nQuality Control Mechanisms\n​\nPRM implements several quality control mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and consistency of its outputs:\nUniform Formatting\n: The FormatResearchAgent ensures consistent formatting across all research outputs:\nasync function async_format_section(research_output, format_section_prompt):\nCreate async queue for communication\nFind reference topic with longest text\nCreate formatting instruction template\nCreate formatting chain with LLM\nFor each topic and text:\nIf not reference topic:\nCreate task to format candidate text\nElse:\nAdd to output without formatting\nProcess queue until all tasks complete\nReturn formatted research outputs\nDe-duplication\n: Removes redundant information across research outputs:\nasync function async_remove_duplicates(research_output, remove_duplicates_prompt):\nCreate async queue for communication\nCreate deduplication instruction template\nCreate deduplication chain with LLM\nTrack processed pairs to avoid duplicate work\nFor each reference topic/text pair:\nFor each candidate topic/text pair:\nIf not same topic and not already processed:\nCreate task to deduplicate candidate text\nMark pair as processed\nElse:\nAdd to output without deduplication\nProcess queue until all tasks complete\nReturn deduplicated research outputs\nCitation Requirements\n: Ensures all information is properly cited with source details:\nThe system enforces strict citation requirements, ensuring that every fact, figure, date, and quote is properly attributed to its source with a standardized citation format that includes the source name, publication date, headline, and full web address.\nThese quality control mechanisms ensure that PRM produces outputs that are accurate, well-structured, and properly cited.\nDemo Video\n​\nA demonstration video of the Press Release Miner (PRM) in action is available at the following link:\nPress Release Miner Demo Video\nConclusion\n​\nPress Release Miner represents a significant advancement in agentic AI systems for research and content generation. By implementing sophisticated agentic patterns such as multi-agent coordination, specialized tool usage, and parallel processing, PRM demonstrates how AI can effectively automate complex knowledge work while maintaining high standards of quality.\nThe system's architecture—with its specialized agents, diverse tools, and comprehensive data sources—provides a blueprint for designing effective multi-agent systems for other knowledge work applications. The implementation details, particularly around prompt engineering and quality control, offer valuable insights into ensuring AI-generated content meets professional standards.\nAs agentic AI systems continue to evolve, the patterns and approaches demonstrated in PRM will likely influence the design of future systems across various domains, from research and content generation to data analysis and decision support.\nWas this helpful?\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nPress Release Drafter (PRD)\nNext\nAMIGO\nIntroduction\nSystem Architecture Overview\nThe PRM Process\nSystem Architecture\nUI Components\nAgents\nTools\nData Sources\nAgentic Patterns in PRM\nMulti-Agent Coordination\nTool Usage Patterns\nParallel Processing\nAgent Specialization and Collaboration\nTechnical Implementation\nLLM Integration\nTechnologies Used\nPrompt Engineering\nQuality Control Mechanisms\nDemo Video\nConclusion\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

Wolf\nEBA Lead: Eric A. Wolf\nContributors & Reviewers: n/a\nSummary:\nAccurate and timely reporting of safety events disclosed in digital consumer channels is critical for patient safety and to comply with global regulations.  While there are no generally-available enterprise solutions to automate adverse event/product complaint detection or routing yet, significant progress is underway.\nDigital consumer channels which require AE/PC detection include incoming email, chatbots, voicebots, survey free-text, and web/mobile application free-text.  Projects needing this capability should connect with the individual(s) mentioned above and teams referenced below.\nUse Case/Scenario\nTech Recommendation\nCurrent Positiong\nFuture Direction\nAdverse event/product complaint detection in US drug product chatbots and TLAC voicebot conversations\nUse Authenticx 3rd Party AE/PC Detection Service\nSpecialized for US product chatbots US TLAC customer voicebot channels only\nWill migrate to using the emerging AI-based detection service capability in 2026\nAdverse event/product complaint detection in all other chatbot/voicebot conversations or survey/application free-text\nn/a – Use 100% human analysis of all consumer communications to identify safety events\nDeclining\nPlan to use emerging AI-based detection service capability planned for 1H 2026\nSafety event routing for Authenticx AE/PC service to Lilly safety case management systems (AE and PC)\nLeverage DHISP MuleSoft workflow to route to GCC for agent processing and downstream transmission to the Lilly Safety System and Veeva QMS.\nSpecialized for Authenticx and legacy applications\nWill migrate to the forthcoming LRL ClearPath safety event routing service in 2026\nSafety event routing to Lilly safety case management systems (AE and PC)\nPer-product direct system integration with the Lilly Safety System (adverse events) and/or Veeva QMS (product complaints) platforms, as needed.\nDeclining\nUse the forthcoming LRL ClearPath safety event routing service as the single enterprise endpoint for AE/PC submission coming 2H 2026\nUse Cases – Adverse Event/Product Complaint Detection\nDetection requires the analysis of consumer communications (e.g. chatbot text, voicebot transcript, etc.) to identify potential safety events.  Currently, that requires human agents to manually scan all communications and report events.  This is labor intensive, not a good use of human talent, and not easily scalable.  This problem requires automation but goes well beyond just simple keyword scanning.\nThe Lilly Advanced Intelligence (AI) group is currently developing artificial intelligence models to detect these events.  The Customer Engagement group in Software Product Engineering (SPE) will be building a service layer to invoke these models and develop the infrastructure necessary to provide logging, monitoring, and risk-based human review.\nThis advanced detection enterprise service offering is expected 1H 2026.\nCurrent Approach\nOwning Org/Team\nManual human review of all patient communications and manual identification of potential safety events using standard Lilly and industry criteria.\nn/a\nEmerging Approach\nOwning Org/Team\nA new enterprise Lilly AE/PC detection service (API) which leverages AI models to detect safety events in the provided communication stream.  The solution will also employ named entity recognition to use AI to also detect and extract key elements of the safety event, itself (e.g. reporter contact information, suspect product name, reported batch #, etc.).\nLilly Advanced Intelligence (AI), Software Product Engineering (SPE)\nAE/PC Routing\n​\nUse Case – Adverse Event/Product Complaint Routing\nOnce a potential adverse event and/or product complaint has been identified, it must be routed to the appropriate Lilly safety case management platform for processing and reporting.  Currently, the Lilly Safety System (LSS) is the platform for adverse events and Veeva QMS is the platform for product complaints.  Today, this requires separate integrations between different products and these platforms.\nThis creates multiple, redundant interfaces; risk in processing events differently across these interfaces; and it creates unnecessary burden to maintain and support multiple integrations providing the same function.\nThe LRL Software Engineering Hub is working to develop an single, enterprise routing service to replace all of these separate integrations.\nThis enterprise service offering is expected for general use starting 2H 2026.\nCurrent Approach\nSeparate, per-system integration to Mosaic/Lilly Safety System (adverse events) and to Veeva QMS (product complaints).\nn/a – each team develops their own\nEmerging Approach\nSingle, enterprise AE/PC ingest API endpoint which manages appropriate routing to downstream case management platforms.\nLRL Software Engineering Hub (SEH)\nAdditional Considerations\n​\nRationale\nJust as Lilly requires its employees to report cases of adverse events (AEs), product complaints (PCs), suspect products, and tampering(1), Lilly also requires that any mention of the same in a Lilly-provided digital channel also be reported.  This means that any externally-facing digital product which enables communications from consumers (e.g. Lilly chatbots, voicebots, online surveys with free-text fields, web/mobile applications with free-text fields, etc) needs to also identify and route potential safety events.\n(1) Lilly's Ethics and Compliance Procedure (US & PR), Section 4.3.\nhttps://now.lilly.com/page/global-ethics-and-compliance-requirements\nhttps://collab.lilly.com/sites/GSLD_TrainingMaterialsActive/EC/Policies_Procedures/Procedure_Training_Resource/Batch_1_2024/Reporting_AE_and_PC/EN_PCoE_PTR_Reporting_AE_PC.pdf\nhttps://lilly.service-now.com/ec?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=f69fac9a873eea149c2e0d4c8bbb3559\n“Real-Time” vs. “Best Quality” Detection\nThe best AE/PC detection approach likely requires analyzing the entire communication dialog, potentially leveraging multiple AI models, and might even require escalation to a human expert.  This can take significantly longer time but provides fewer false negatives.  This is preferred from a patient safety and compliance perspective.\nHowever, some situations are different and may require a different approach.  If one wants to detect safety events in the midst of a live, two-way conversation (for example, to redirect the user to a more appropriate tool), it warrants more rapid analysis but runs the risk of missing things (higher false negatives).  In fact, an overly aggressive detection approach in live conversations could be perceived as “nagging” and could impact the end user experience.\nA combination of approaches may be warranted to provide the best user experience and achieve the best detection for patient safety.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nsolution-guide\nbusiness-enablement\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n🗄️ Business Enablement BLT\nNext\n🧭 Customer Engagement Reference Architecture\nAE/PC Routing\nAdditional Considerations\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

It enables users to:\nQuickly locate and understand data through metadata, lineage, and quality scores.\nAvoid duplication and reduce time spent searching for data.\nSupport self-service analytics by empowering non-technical users to find and use data confidently.\nLilly creates two things: Medicine and Data. A LOT of data. Data catalogs help Lilly manage that data to help us ensure we know where the data is, who owns it, how sensitive it is, and describes that data. Quality descriptions of data help teams identify if the data is good for their use case, enables AI to use the data effectively, and define what the data can, or cannot, be used for.\nLilly is a global company and so has challenges due to the different types of data collected, the technologies it is stored in, and the many different global governance rules that dictate what the data can be used for. Enterprise Data is helping Lilly meet those challenges by building a robust catalog solution that serves as single source of truth for metadata describing our data, access to that data, and a doorway to view observability facets of that data. A single solution for Lilly to describe and manage Lilly data.\nThe solution is provided through two applications found at\ndata.lilly.com\nMetadata Manager to manage catalog records\nMarketplace to manage access to data\nMetadata Manager\n​\nMetadata Manager\nenables consistent metadata collection, classification, and governance across enterprise inventories.

It is a set of practices that aims to automate, simplify, and standardize machine learning workflows, processes, or deployments. Its goal is to decrease time-to-value, maintain and improve model performance over time, and ensure that machine learning delivers sustained business impact.\nKey Concepts\n​\nDevOps:\nMLOps builds directly on the foundational principles of DevOps. DevOps is a set of practices that unifies software development and IT operations, emphasizing automation, collaboration, and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) to streamline software deployment and improve reliability.\nMLOps extends these principles to the unique challenges of machine learning, adding processes for managing data, tracking experiments, and monitoring models in production. MLOps incorporates both code and data, ensuring that machine learning models are reproducible, scalable, and maintainable throughout their lifecycle.\nInfrastructure as Code:\nA foundational practice in MLOps that enables teams to automate the provisioning and management of computing resources using code, rather than manual processes. By defining infrastructure in version-controlled scripts, we can ensure that machine learning environments are consistent, reproducible, and scalable across development, testing, and production. This approach accelerates model deployment, reduces configuration errors, and optimizes resource usage—making it easier to manage complex ML workflows and adapt quickly to changing requirements.\nArtifact Storage\n​\nArtifact storage in MLOps unifies the management of code, data, and model objects, creating a reliable foundation for scalable, reproducible, and auditable machine learning operations.\nCode:\nCode artifacts encompass everything from infrastructure scripts to model training routines and pipeline definitions. Storing code in version-controlled repositories (such as Git) allows teams to track changes, collaborate effectively, and reproduce experiments. This practice ensures that the exact code used for model development and deployment is always accessible, supporting robust CI/CD workflows and minimizing configuration drift.\nData:\nData artifacts include raw datasets, processed features, and metadata generated throughout the ML pipeline. Centralized storage solutions—such as feature stores or cloud object stores—enable teams to manage data lineage, version datasets, and maintain high data quality. Automated pipelines facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL/ELT) of data, while lineage tracking and metadata management provide visibility into how data evolves and is used across experiments.\nModel Objects:\nModel objects refer to the serialized representations of trained machine learning models, such as\n.pkl\n,\n.joblib\n, or framework-specific files. These artifacts are stored in model registries or cloud storage, allowing for easy retrieval, deployment, and monitoring. By cataloging and versioning model objects, teams can roll back to previous versions, audit model changes, and ensure that only validated models are promoted to production.\nOverview of Common Technologies\n​\nMany ML tools and platforms have similar functionality. Part of the consideration for these tools will be dependent on the environment you deploy your models in (AWS vs Azure vs CATS vs AWB, etc). MagTrain/Run.AI is a great environment for model training specifically. Additional consideration will be simply in terms of technologies you may already be familiar with (Kubernetes, Docker, Nextflow, etc). When going through the AI registry process, MLOps can also be discussed as part of the architecture review.\nOverview of Common Patterns\n​\nCommon patterns include modular pipelines for data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation; CI/CD workflows for automated deployment; and monitoring frameworks for drift detection and performance tracking. These patterns emphasize reproducibility, scalability, and collaboration between data science and engineering.\nHow to Get Started at Lilly\n​\nAs stated previously, the environment your project is in will help drive decisions on which tools to use. When filling out the AI registry for your project, be sure to ask about or include MLOps when having your architecture review discussion – the AI architects can help guide in the best solution for your specific use case.\nFurther Information on Setting Up MLOps Tools\n​\nEnterprise Data Team:\nhttps://data.lilly.com/\nThe AWB platform already has installations of Sagemaker, MLFlow, and Fabric.\nCloud Team:\nhttps://cloud.lilly.com/lcs/\nFor Azure, AWS, or other cloud deployment.\nCATS:\nhttps://cats.lilly.com/\nFor deploying workflows via the CATS platform.\nMagTrain:\nhttps://github.com/EliLillyCo/MagTrain\nFor using the MagTrain cluster to run/train models.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nsoftware-engineering\nsolution-guide\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nAPI Standards\nNext\n🧭 Test Automation\nWhat is MLOPS?\nKey Concepts\nArtifact Storage\nOverview of Common Technologies\nOverview of Common Patterns\nHow to Get Started at Lilly\nFurther Information on Setting Up MLOps Tools\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

Traditional network monitoring (SNMP, basic ping) only confirms connectivity; it does not reveal performance bottlenecks, security lateral movement, or application transaction latency caused by the network itself. An AI-ready strategy treats the network as a high-fidelity sensor for application behavior and security.\nThe Goal: Move beyond monitoring device health to understanding network behavior and traffic flow, ensuring low-latency delivery of critical business services and providing rich security context.\nThe Three Imperatives for AI-Ready Network Data\nTo unlock advanced use cases like network-based anomaly detection and security investigation, architects must prioritize the collection of high-context, rich network data.\nNetwork Flow Data (NetFlow, IPFIX, V-Flow)\nFlow data reveals who is talking to whom, how much, and for how long. This is crucial for capacity planning, cost allocation, and identifying unexpected traffic patterns.\nRequirement\nWhy it Matters\nActionable Guidance\nComprehensive Coverage\nFlow data must be collected across the entire enterprise (data center, cloud VPCs, and endpoints) to avoid blind spots in east-west traffic.\nMandate flow logging in all cloud environments (VPC Flow Logs) and ensure on-prem network devices (routers/switches) are configured to export NetFlow/IPFIX to a central collector.\nConsistent Aggregation\nOver-aggregating flow data loses granularity needed for forensic analysis and machine learning pattern detection.\nSet flow export timers appropriately (e.g., 60 seconds or less). Use flow analysis tools that retain detailed, unsummarized flow records for at least 30 days.\nHigh-Fidelity Packet Data (The \"Deep Dive\")\nPacket data (or deep packet inspection/DPI) provides the unfiltered, raw ground truth necessary for troubleshooting complex, intermittent latency issues or validating application protocol behavior.\nRequirement\nWhy it Matters\nActionable Guidance\nIntelligent Capture and Storage\nStoring all packets is prohibitively expensive. Only metadata and suspicious packets should be retained long-term.\nDeploy network agents/probes that perform Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to extract application-level metadata (e.g., HTTP response codes, database queries) and only capture/store full packets when triggered by a flow anomaly or security alert.\nDecrypted Insight\nEncrypted traffic prevents analysis. The monitoring solution must be able to view traffic after decryption.\nImplement monitoring points behind load balancers/proxies where TLS decryption has already occurred, or integrate with decryption technologies (e.g., in a cloud environment or using security tools).\nNetwork Metadata & Health (The \"Context\")\nThis category includes SNMP data, device configuration, and synthetic health checks that provide context about the network's state.\nRequirement\nWhy it Matters\nActionable Guidance\nService Dependency Mapping\nNetwork components (firewalls, load balancers) are critical service dependencies and must be mapped to the business service model.\nIntegrate network discovery tools (e.g., NetBrain, network configuration management systems) with your AIOps Service Model to automatically update component relationships.\nAgentless vs. Agent-Based\nUsing the right tool for the job. SNMP is great for device health; agents are great for endpoint performance.\nUse SNMP for core router/switch health (CPU, interface stats). Use lightweight agents on servers for local network latency and throughput tests (synthetic checks).\nArchitectural Decision: The Network Data Collector Strategy\nNetwork data collection demands specialized collectors due to high volume (flows) and processing power requirements (packets). Architects must choose the right collector placement and type.\nComponent\nFunction\nStrategic Placement\nWhy it Matters\nDedicated Flow Collector\nIngests, normalizes, and indexes high-volume NetFlow/IPFIX records.\nCentralized Logging/Analytics Zone\nDecouples flow ingestion from performance of core routing infrastructure.\nDPI/Packet Probe\nPerforms Deep Packet Inspection and extracts application metadata.\nBehind Load Balancers or Critical Network Taps\nRequires high-performance hardware/VMs; placement must be strategic to capture relevant application traffic.\nCloud VPC Flow Logs\nCaptures all internal (east-west) traffic within the cloud boundary.\nIntegrated via Native Cloud Services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob)\nEnsures visibility into internal microservice communication, which is often a blind spot.\nThe \"Single Pane of Network Truth\" Insight\nAvoid maintaining separate tools for flow, packet, and SNMP data. Architect for a single observability platform that can ingest all three data types and use a common correlation key (IP, port, hostname) to link them instantly.\nReal-World Use Cases: Best-Fit Technology\nIntegrating comprehensive network data enables advanced analysis far beyond simple network performance monitoring.\nScenario\nGoal & Business Value\nTechnology Focus\nTroubleshooting Intermittent Latency\nGoal: Prove or disprove that a performance issue is network-related (Faster RCA).\nFocus: Cross-correlation between APM trace data and high-fidelity Packet/DPI metadata to pinpoint the exact hop or network segment introducing delay.\nShadow IT & Security Audit\nGoal: Detect unauthorized internal communication, data exfiltration, or new unknown services (Reduced Security Risk).\nFocus: Machine learning on Flow Data to baseline normal traffic volumes and ports, alerting on sudden spikes or unusual protocol usage (Network Behavioral Analysis).\nBandwidth Hog Identification\nGoal: Proactively manage and allocate network capacity across different business units (Cost Optimization).\nFocus: Analyzing Flow Data aggregated by user, application, or geography to identify top bandwidth consumers and plan network upgrades or traffic shaping.\nVPN/Remote Access Monitoring\nGoal: Ensure a quality experience for remote workers and identify regional ISP or last-mile issues (Improved End-User Experience).\nFocus: Synthetic agents on remote user endpoints performing continuous Network Latency Checks and reporting back to the central monitoring platform.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nobservability\nsolution-guide\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nLog Management & Analytics\nNext\n🧭 Resiliency & Disaster Recovery\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",

This encompasses disaster recovery (DR) capabilities, high availability (HA)\narchitecture, and business continuity planning. Proper resiliency ensures that critical business functions continue\noperating during hardware failures, software issues, network outages, or even catastrophic events. This document\nprovides guidance on determining your application's resiliency requirements based on business criticality and\nimplementing appropriate architectural patterns to achieve the required level of service availability.\nResiliency Design Steps\n​\nAssess Application Criticality\n: Begin by identifying the Business Application CI ID in ServiceNow. Detailed\ninstructions can be found in the\nDetermine Application Criticality document\n.\nThis step is crucial for understanding the criticality of your application within its business context.\nDefine Resiliency Requirements\n: Next, use the\n[Resiliency Tier / Infrastructure Matrix](#resiliency-tier--infrastructure-matrix) below to determine the system's\nresiliency requirements. This will help you identify the necessary measures to ensure your application's availability\nand reliability. You can also refer to the\nResiliency Requirements document\nfor additional detail for your application's tier.\nImplement Resilient Architecture\n: Based on your application's tier, follow the guidelines in the\nResiliency Patterns document\n.\nThis resource provides comprehensive information on building high resiliency for various infrastructure components\nlike VMs, databases, and containers. It also explains different disaster recovery (DR) models, helping you design a\nrobust and fault-tolerant system.\nCritical Systems Governance\n​\nTier 0, Critical Systems and Local HA Manufacturing must follow the governance processes for Critical Systems,\ndocumented here\n.\nResiliency Tier / Infrastructure Matrix\n​\nTier\nCloud\nOn-Prem\nTier 0-A\n[Tier 0-A](#tier-0-a)\nsame as cloud\nTier 0-B\n[Tier 0-B](#tier-0-b)\nsame as cloud\nCritical High\n[Critical High](#critical-high-cloud)\n[Critical High](#critical-high-on-prem)\nCritical Medium\n[Critical Medium](#critical-medium-cloud)\n[Critical Medium](#critical-medium-on-prem)\nCritical Low\n[Critical Low](#critical-low-cloud)\n[Critical Low](#critical-low-on-prem)\nLocal HA Manufacturing\nN/A\n[Local HA Manufacturing](#local-ha-manufacturing)\nAll Other Systems\n[All Other Systems](#all-other-systems)\nsame as cloud\nIf you have a system where you only want a subset of critical recovered after a disaster, rather than the entire app\nrefer to [this section](#critical-data) .\nTier 0-A\n​\nThis tier includes critical applications like authentication and networking.
