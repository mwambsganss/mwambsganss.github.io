Its primary purpose is to answer questions and generate briefing documents for key stakeholders using standard Eli Lilly language and style. The system employs a sophisticated agentic architecture that coordinates multiple specialized AI agents working together to conduct comprehensive research and produce high-quality content.\nPRM addresses a critical need in corporate communications: conducting thorough research and generating media briefing documents for executives that ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistent messaging. By automating this process through an agentic approach, PRM significantly reduces the time and effort required while maintaining high standards of quality and consistency.\nSystem Architecture Overview\n​\nTools\nAgents\nUI Components\nExternal Data Sources\nNews Journals\\n(NYT, WP, WSJ, etc.)\nWeb Search\\n(DDG, Bing)\nYouTube Transcriptions\nWikipedia\nInternal Data Sources\nLilly Press Release\nEarnings Call Transcripts\nPrior Briefing Documents\nResearch Topic\nResearch Factors\nHuman Interaction\nBriefing Document\nResearch Planner\\nContextualization Agent\nResearcher\\nResearch Agent (CoT / ToT)\nSynthesizer\\nInterview / Q&A Agent\nCopyeditor\\nFormatting Agent\nRAG\nWeb Search\nYouTube\nWikipedia\nThe diagram above illustrates the architecture of the Press Release Miner system, showing how UI components, specialized agents, tools, and data sources interact to create a comprehensive research and content generation pipeline.\nThe PRM Process\n​\nThe Press Release Miner follows a structured six-step process to generate comprehensive briefing documents:\nDevelop a research plan\n: The system begins by analyzing the research topic and developing a strategic plan for gathering information. This includes identifying key factors and questions that need to be addressed.\nSearch internal press releases\n: PRM leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to search through Eli Lilly's internal press releases, extracting relevant information and insights.\nSearch web for news sources\n: The system extends its research to external sources, searching trusted news outlets and websites for additional context and information.\nConduct follow-up research\n: Based on initial findings, PRM performs deeper, targeted research to fill knowledge gaps and answer specific questions that arise.\nSynthesize research results\n: The system integrates information from multiple sources, removing duplicates and organizing content into a coherent structure with proper citations.\nGenerate briefing document\n: Finally, PRM produces a well-formatted briefing document that adheres to Eli Lilly's language and style guidelines.\nThis entire process is orchestrated through approximately 50 LLM calls, distributed across various agents and tools within the system.\nSystem Architecture\n​\nPRM's architecture consists of four main components: UI interfaces, specialized agents, tools, and data sources. These components work together to create a seamless research and content generation pipeline.\nUI Components\n​\nResearch Topic\n: Interface for users to input the main subject for research\nResearch Factors\n: Display and selection of key aspects to investigate\nHuman Interaction\n: Interface for user feedback and guidance during the research process\nBriefing Document\n: Final output display with the generated content\nAgents\n​\nPRM employs four specialized agents, each with distinct responsibilities:\nResearch Planner (Contextualization Agent)\n: Responsible for understanding the research topic, breaking it down into manageable components, and developing a comprehensive research strategy. This agent provides the overall direction for the research process.\nResearcher (Research Agent/CoT/ToT)\n: The primary information gathering agent that executes the research plan. It utilizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning to conduct thorough investigations across multiple sources.\nSynthesizer (Interview/Q&A Agent)\n: Processes and integrates the collected information, identifying patterns, resolving contradictions, and organizing content into a coherent narrative. This agent can also generate follow-up questions to fill information gaps.\nCopyeditor (Formatting Agent)\n: Ensures the final document adheres to Eli Lilly's style guidelines, maintains consistent formatting, and includes proper citations for all information sources.\nTools\n​\nThe agents leverage several tools to perform their tasks:\nRAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)\n: Enables semantic search across internal documents, retrieving relevant information based on context rather than just keywords.\nWeb Search\n: Interfaces with search engines (primarily Bing) to gather information from trusted external sources.\nYouTube\n: Extracts information from video content, particularly from news channels and official company presentations.\nWikipedia\n: Provides background information and context for topics and entities mentioned in the research.\nData Sources\n​\nPRM accesses both internal and external data sources:\nInternal Data Sources\n:\nLilly Press Releases\nEarnings Call Transcripts\nPrior Briefing Documents\nExternal Data Sources\n:\nNews Journals (NYT, WP, WSJ, etc.)\nWeb Search Results (DDG, Bing)\nYouTube Transcriptions\nWikipedia\nAgentic Patterns in PRM\n​\nThe Press Release Miner implements several sophisticated agentic patterns that enable effective coordination, parallel processing, and specialized task execution. These patterns represent the cutting edge of multi-agent system design and contribute significantly to PRM's effectiveness.\nMulti-Agent Coordination\n​\nPRM's architecture demonstrates how multiple specialized agents can work together to accomplish complex tasks. The system implements a coordination mechanism that allows agents to:\nShare context\n: Agents pass information and context to each other, ensuring continuity throughout the research process.\nSequential processing\n: The Research Planner sets the direction, followed by the Researcher gathering information, the Synthesizer integrating it, and finally the Copyeditor formatting the output.\nFeedback loops\n: Agents can request additional information or clarification from other agents when needed, creating a dynamic research process.\nThis coordination pattern enables each agent to focus on its specialized task while contributing to the overall goal of producing a comprehensive briefing document.\nTool Usage Patterns\n​\nPRM implements three distinct tool usage patterns across its agents:\nTool Calling Pattern\n: The system uses a structured approach for agents to invoke tools, with clear input/output specifications. This pattern is implemented in\ntool_calling_tool.py\n, which creates a runnable agent that can use multiple tools based on a system template and human instructions.\nfunction tool_calling_runnable(tool_runtime):\nInitialize system template from tool_runtime\nCopy and initialize tools from tool_runtime\nFor each tool:\nAdd tool name and description to system template\nCreate prompt template with system template, human template, and agent scratchpad\nCreate tool-calling agent with LLM, tools, and prompt\nReturn agent executor with configured agent and tools\nReAct Pattern (Reasoning and Acting)\n: PRM implements the ReAct pattern in\nreact_tool.py\n, allowing agents to alternate between reasoning about their next steps and taking actions. This pattern enhances the agent's ability to plan and execute complex research tasks.\nfunction react_agent_runnable(tool_runtime):\nCopy and initialize tools from tool_runtime\nCreate prompt from react template\nCreate ReAct agent with LLM, tools, and prompt\nReturn agent executor with configured agent and tools\nSelf-Ask Pattern\n: Implemented in\nself_ask_tool.py\n, this pattern enables agents to break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions, answer them sequentially, and then synthesize a final answer. This is particularly useful for complex research topics that require multi-step reasoning.\nfunction self_ask_runnable(tool_runtime):\nCopy tools from tool_runtime\nSelect first tool and rename it to \"Intermediate Answer\"\nCreate prompt from self-ask template\nCreate self-ask agent with LLM, tool, and prompt\nReturn agent executor with configured agent and tool\nParallel Processing\n​\nOne of PRM's most powerful features is its ability to conduct research on multiple topics or factors simultaneously. This is implemented through the\nparallelization_tool.py\n, which enables:\nConcurrent tool execution\n: Multiple tools can be executed in parallel across different research topics.\nAsynchronous processing\n: The system uses Python's asyncio to manage concurrent tasks efficiently.\nResult aggregation\n: Results from parallel processes are collected and integrated into a coherent output.\nasync function async_parallel_tool_call(topics, tool_runtime, id_task, target):\nCreate queue for communication\nCreate empty tasks list\nFor each topic:\nCreate async task for processing topic and add to tasks list\nWhile true:\nGet item from queue\nYield item to caller\nMark task as done\nIf all tasks are done and queue is empty:\nBreak loop\nAwait all tasks to complete\nThis parallel processing capability significantly reduces the time required to conduct comprehensive research across multiple topics or factors.\nAgent Specialization and Collaboration\n​\nPRM demonstrates how specialized agents can collaborate effectively to produce high-quality outputs. Each agent has a specific role:\nResearch Pipeline Agent\n: Orchestrates the overall research process, managing the flow of information between other agents and tools.\nclass ResearchPipeline:\nfunction __init__(llm, bing_subscription_key, retriever, templates, etc):\nStore all parameters as instance variables\nInitialize tools array with web search, RAG, and other tools\nCreate dictionary of agent runnables (simple, react, self-ask)\nInitialize tool runtime configuration\nasync function research_question(target, agent_type):\nSelect appropriate agent type\nFor each event from parallel tool execution:\nYield event to caller\nasync function research_question_with_factors(target, topics, format_section_prompt, remove_duplicates_prompt, agent_type):\nSelect appropriate agent type\nProcess research results in parallel\nFormat and deduplicate results\nYield final output\nFormatting Agent\n: Specializes in ensuring consistent formatting and removing duplicates across research outputs.\nclass FormatResearchAgent:\nfunction __init__(llm):\nStore LLM as instance variable\nasync function async_format_section(research_output, format_section_prompt):\nFind reference text with maximum length\nCreate formatting instruction with reference and candidate texts\nCreate formatting chain with LLM\nProcess each research output for uniform formatting\nReturn formatted outputs\nasync function async_remove_duplicates(research_output, remove_duplicates_prompt):\nCreate deduplication instruction template\nCreate deduplication chain with LLM\nCompare each pair of research outputs\nRemove duplicate information\nReturn deduplicated outputs\nBrainstorming Agent\n: Generates research factors and questions to guide the research process.\nfunction brainstorming_agent(brainstorming_prompt_template, llm):\nCreate prompt template with target variable and max 5 items limit\nCreate LLM chain with prompt and LLM\nReturn the chain for generating research factors\nThis specialization allows each agent to focus on what it does best while contributing to the overall system goal.\nTechnical Implementation\n​\nLLM Integration\n​\nPRM integrates with Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model to power its agents. The system makes approximately 50 LLM calls throughout the research and content generation process, distributed across various agents and tasks. The LLM integration is managed through a custom model class that handles authentication and API interactions with Azure OpenAI services and AWS resources.\nTechnologies Used\n​\nPRM leverages several key technologies:\nLangChain\n: Used extensively for agent creation, tool integration, and prompt management. LangChain provides the foundation for the agentic patterns implemented in PRM.\nFastAPI\n: Powers the backend API, providing WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication during the research process.\nFAISS\n: Implements the vector store for efficient semantic search across internal documents.\nAzure OpenAI\n: Provides the LLM capabilities that power the agents' reasoning and content generation.\nBing Search API\n: Enables web search functionality for gathering information from external sources.\nPrompt Engineering\n​\nPrompt engineering is a critical aspect of PRM's implementation. The system uses carefully crafted prompts to guide each agent's behavior and ensure high-quality outputs. For example:\nResearch Agent Prompt\n: Guides the research process with specific instructions for gathering comprehensive information:\n# The research agent prompt instructs the agent to gather detailed information with proper citations, format responses with chronological ordering and bulleted lists, and ensure all facts are properly attributed to their sources.\nFormatting Agent Prompt\n: Ensures consistent formatting and structure across research outputs:\n# The formatting agent prompt guides the agent to combine research outputs from multiple sources into a cohesive document, maintain proper citations for all facts and figures, and structure the content with appropriate headings and subheadings.\nDe-duplication Prompt\n: Removes redundant information across research outputs:\n# The de-duplication prompt instructs the agent to compare reference and candidate texts, remove duplicate facts, quotes, and figures from the candidate text, and ensure the final output has no redundant information while maintaining coherent flow.\nThese prompts are critical for guiding the agents' behavior and ensuring they produce outputs that meet Eli Lilly's standards for quality and consistency.\nQuality Control Mechanisms\n​\nPRM implements several quality control mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and consistency of its outputs:\nUniform Formatting\n: The FormatResearchAgent ensures consistent formatting across all research outputs:\nasync function async_format_section(research_output, format_section_prompt):\nCreate async queue for communication\nFind reference topic with longest text\nCreate formatting instruction template\nCreate formatting chain with LLM\nFor each topic and text:\nIf not reference topic:\nCreate task to format candidate text\nElse:\nAdd to output without formatting\nProcess queue until all tasks complete\nReturn formatted research outputs\nDe-duplication\n: Removes redundant information across research outputs:\nasync function async_remove_duplicates(research_output, remove_duplicates_prompt):\nCreate async queue for communication\nCreate deduplication instruction template\nCreate deduplication chain with LLM\nTrack processed pairs to avoid duplicate work\nFor each reference topic/text pair:\nFor each candidate topic/text pair:\nIf not same topic and not already processed:\nCreate task to deduplicate candidate text\nMark pair as processed\nElse:\nAdd to output without deduplication\nProcess queue until all tasks complete\nReturn deduplicated research outputs\nCitation Requirements\n: Ensures all information is properly cited with source details:\nThe system enforces strict citation requirements, ensuring that every fact, figure, date, and quote is properly attributed to its source with a standardized citation format that includes the source name, publication date, headline, and full web address.\nThese quality control mechanisms ensure that PRM produces outputs that are accurate, well-structured, and properly cited.\nDemo Video\n​\nA demonstration video of the Press Release Miner (PRM) in action is available at the following link:\nPress Release Miner Demo Video\nConclusion\n​\nPress Release Miner represents a significant advancement in agentic AI systems for research and content generation.
