This leads to high costs, poor performance, and unusable data for AI models.\n:::\n---\n## Why This Matters: From Dumb Storage to Smart Context\nTraditional log management focused on storing raw text for compliance. Today, logs must be structured, correlated, and enriched to support real-time diagnostics, RCA, and predictive analytics. A modern log strategy transforms high-volume, unstructured data into low-latency, high-value insights.\n---\n## The Three Imperatives for AI-Ready Logs\n### 1. Structured Ingestion (The \"Parser\")\n:::info[Structured Logging]\n- Enforce JSON or key-value format at the source (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J)\n- Mandate NTP synchronization across all hosts\n- Use ISO 8601 timestamps with timezone offsets\n:::\n### 2. Intelligent Routing & Filtering (The \"Pipeline\")\n:::info[Smart Pipelines]\n- Filter debug/heartbeat logs at the edge using DSP or Fluent Bit\n- Route high-value logs (e.g., security events) to long-term indexes\n- Use short-term, low-cost storage for transient logs\n:::\n### 3. Cross-Domain Correlation (The \"Link\")\n:::info[Unified Correlation]\n- Tag all logs with host_id, service_name, and trace_id\n- Enrich logs with CMDB metadata (e.g., environment, owner, tier)\n- Enable one-click pivot between metrics and logs in observability platforms\n:::\n---\n## Architectural Decision: The Log Pipeline Strategy\nComponentFunctionBest-Fit TechnologiesCollector/ForwarderGathers logs from servers, containers, endpointsUnified Agents (Splunk, Dynatrace), Fluentd| Processor/Router    | Filters, structures, enriches, and routes data       | Splunk DSP, Logstash, Fluent Bit                 |\n| Analytical Store    | Indexes structured data for search and ML            | Splunk, Elasticsearch, Databricks, Athena        |\n:::tip[Process Near the Source]\nPlace filtering and structuring logic in the collector or forwarder to reduce bandwidth and indexing load.\n:::\n---\n## Technology Details\n### Splunk Enterprise + DSP\nStrategic platform for enterprise-wide log analytics. DSP enables edge filtering, enrichment, and routing. Deep integration with ITSI and CMDB supports RCA and AIOps.\n### Splunk SIEM\nStandard platform for security log analytics. Supports long-term retention, forensic investigation, and compliance reporting. Integrates with syslog, Windows Event Logs, and audit frameworks.\n### Fluentd + Databricks\nSpecialized solution for business activity monitoring. Fluentd collects structured logs; Databricks transforms them into metrics for dashboarding and analysis.\n### ELK Stack\nStandard open-source stack for developer debugging and QA. Elasticsearch indexes logs; Logstash parses and routes; Kibana visualizes. Ideal for CI/CD pipelines.\n### Amazon S3 + Athena\nCost-effective solution for long-term log retention. Fluent Bit routes logs to S3; Athena enables SQL-based querying. Best for low-frequency access and compliance storage.\n---\n## Real-World Use Cases\nScenarioGoal & Business ValueTechnology FocusSecurity & Compliance AuditingMeet SOC 2/PCI requirements, enable forensic investigationSplunk SIEM, Elastic Security| Business Activity Monitoring    | Track user sign-ups, order volume, feature usage                   | Fluentd, Databricks                                   |\n| Advanced AIOps Pattern Detection| Detect event sequences that precede failures                       | Splunk ITSI, Unified Agent                            |\n| Troubleshooting (RCA)          | Jump from metric anomaly to root cause log                         | Splunk ITSI, ELK Stack                                |\n---\n### Recommendations to Improve Guide Usability\n1. **Add Architecture Diagrams** showing the log pipeline from source to analytics platform.\n2. **Include Deployment Playbooks** for agent rollout, DSP configuration, and index setup.\n3. **Link to Governance Policies** for log retention, security, and compliance.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nobservability\nsolution-guide\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nInfrastructure Performance Monitoring\nNext\nNetwork Monitoring\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
