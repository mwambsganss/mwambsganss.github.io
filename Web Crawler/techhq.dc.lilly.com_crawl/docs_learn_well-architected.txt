Blueprints for Success
​
In today's tech landscape, elevating our systems is crucial to achieve scale, speed, and innovation. A well-architected
framework helps us design, deploy, and manage our digital workloads effectively, ensuring reliability, security, and
cost-efficiency. Start evaluating digital architecture against best practices to unlock greater value for our business
and customers today!
Well-Architected Pillars
​
Our architecture leverages well-architected frameworks from Microsoft, AWS, and Google. These frameworks share common
pillars that help us design, deploy, and manage systems effectively, whether they are cloud-based, on-premises, hybrid,
or SaaS. By following these pillars, we ensure our systems are robust, secure, and efficient.
Operational Excellence
Run and monitor systems to deliver business value and continuously improve processes. Automate changes, respond to
events, and define standards for daily operations.
Security, Privacy & Compliance
Protect information, systems, and assets. Implement strong identity and access management, safeguard data, maintain
data integrity, and establish controls to detect security and compliance events.
Reliability
Ensure workloads perform their intended functions correctly and consistently. Design systems to recover from
failures, meet customer demands, and mitigate disruptions.
Performance Efficiency
Optimize the use of IT and computing resources to maintain performance. Select the right resource types and sizes,
monitor performance, and make informed decisions to maintain efficiency as business needs evolve.
Cost Optimization
Manage costs to maximize value delivery. Understand and control spending, select cost-effective resources, and
scale to meet business needs without overspending.
Sustainability
(
an emerging pillar, especially for computationally-intensive AI workloads
)
Minimize the environmental impact of cloud workloads. Design and operate systems to reduce energy consumption and
improve efficiency, supporting long-term sustainability goals.
Industry-leading Frameworks
​
To evaluate and improve your system's architecture, start with
one
of these frameworks. Since AWS, Azure, and Google's
well-architected frameworks are so similar, select one based on team comfort and interest. If this is your first time,
we recommend starting with the
AWS Well-architected Tool
, which will
ask you specific questions and record your decisions for future reference.
