Redundant tooling increases cost, complexity, and data fragmentation.\n:::\n## Why This Matters: Shifting from Health Checks to Proactive Intelligence\nInfrastructure Performance Monitoring (IPM) is no longer a passive check of CPU and RAM. For technical leaders and architects, IPM is the foundational data layer that feeds all AIOps, capacity planning, and automation initiatives. A poor IPM strategy creates blind spots, leads to reactive firefighting, and prevents successful deployment of advanced automation.\n### The Goal\nMove from simply knowing that a server is down (reactivity) to understanding why a specific component is degrading a critical business service and predicting the failure before it happens (proactivity).\n---\n## 📊 Architecture Diagram\n!<ExternalLink>[Infrastructure Performance Monitoring Stack Architecture](https://us-prod.asyncgw.teams.microsoft.com/v1/objects/0-cus-d5-7afe023df1b166e88371e957f94c9307/viewsModern Infrastructure Monitoring\nArchitects must ensure the IPM solution collects the right types of data, with sufficient context, to be considered \"AI-Ready.\"\n### 1. High-Cardinality Metrics (The \"What\")</ExternalLink>\n:::info[High-Cardinality Metrics]\n- Use unified agents (e.g., Splunk Observability Agents, Prometheus exporters)\n- Store raw metrics in a TSDB (e.g., Splunk Metrics, Thanos)\n- Retain data for 12–18 months for capacity planning and anomaly detection\n:::\n### 2. Centralized, Structured Logging (The \"Why\")\n:::info[Structured Logging]\n- Enforce JSON format at the source using Fluentd or Logstash\n- Ensure logs are tagged with host metadata for correlation\n- Link logs to topology maps in AIOps platforms (e.g., ITSI)\n:::\n### 3. Topology & Dependency Mapping (The \"Where\")\n:::info[Dependency Mapping]\n- Build service models using CMDB and NetBrain\n- Use automated discovery tools to avoid manual mapping\n- Feed topology into AIOps for impact analysis and prioritization\n:::\n---\n## Architectural Decision: The Unified Agent Strategy\nApproachPros for AIOpsCons for AIOpsUnified Agent (Recommended)Deep context, high-cardinality metrics, logs/traces, automation-readyRequires standardization and operational discipline| Legacy Agentless (SNMP/WMI) | No install required                                                   | Shallow metrics, slow polling, not AI-ready         |\n:::tip[Agent Deployment Insight]\n- Use Sidecar pattern for Kubernetes\n- Use Golden Image for VMs\n- Avoid manual agent installs\n:::\n---\n## Real-World Use Cases: Best-Fit Technology\nScenarioGoal & Business ValueTechnology FocusCapacity Planning & Cost OptimizationPrevent resource exhaustion, justify cloud rightsizing (Cost Savings)TSDB, Splunk/Grafana dashboards, long-term metrics| Proactive Bottleneck Detection | Predict degradation before impact (Improved MTTR)                  | AIOps Platform (ITSI), adaptive thresholds            |\n| Host-Level Self-Healing        | Auto-resolve low-risk issues (Reduced Toil)                        | ITSI + Automation Engine (Ansible)                    |\n| Rapid Root Cause Analysis (RCA) | Accelerate diagnosis (Reduced MTTR)                                | Unified Agent, single-pane correlation                |\n---\n## Technology Details\n### AppDynamics\nStrategic platform for full-stack observability. Deep integration with ServiceNow and Oasis. Supports automated RCA and incident response.\n### Prometheus + Grafana\nOpen-source stack for cloud-native environments. Ideal for Kubernetes and Docker. Supports high-cardinality metrics and custom dashboards.\n### Dynatrace\nAI-powered monitoring with automatic anomaly detection. Supports OpenTelemetry and dynamic environments. Emerging within enterprise AIOps.\n### Nagios\nLegacy tool for basic server and network monitoring. Limited cloud-native support. Consider migration to modern platforms.\n### Datadog\nStandard tool for multi-cloud observability. Unified dashboards and alerting. Supports OpenTelemetry and hybrid environments.\n### SolarWinds NPM\nSpecialized for network performance. SNMP-based telemetry. Ideal for real-time traffic and latency monitoring.\n---\n### Recommendations to Improve Guide Usability\n1. **Add Decision Trees** to help architects choose technologies based on environment type (cloud-native, legacy, hybrid).\n2. **Embed Deployment Playbooks** for agent rollout, TSDB setup, and logging standardization.\n3. **Include Governance Notes** to clarify approval and onboarding processes for each tool.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nobservability\nsolution-guide\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n🗄️ Observability & Reliability BLT\nNext\nLog Management & Analytics\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
