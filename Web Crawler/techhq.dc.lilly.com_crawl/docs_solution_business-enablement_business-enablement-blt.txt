Business Process Workflow Automation unites information, processes, and users to help you automate digital workflows on-premises or on a cloud. Recommended tool for Automating end to end Business Processes/Workflows that increase productivity, improve collaboration between teams, and gain new insight to resolve cases and drive better business outcomes.
Use Cases
​
Non-streamlined Manual Business Process with bottlenecks and In-efficiencies:
Scenarios involving automation of end-to-end business processes where multiple people or departments are working together to achieve a goal. Example: Screen fail process in clinical trials, Material tracking in manufacturing and quality departments etc.
Processes involving reviews and approvals by multiple people
before finalizing a result. Example: A process where documents are produced by one set of people and reviewed and enhanced by another set of people i.e. Translation and Transcription of files.
Use case has a well-defined start, end and in-between steps
to be performed to achieve a specific result.
Use cases which are identified as business processes, and the automation
go-to-market time is of utmost importance.
Example: Product launch processes
Notifications and Task routing required
to achieve
SLA goals.
Example: Complaints and customer claims settlement, Government regulations implementation tracking etc.
Notes
​
While business process automations can be done using multiple tools, platforms and even by developing custom applications, here are some of the scenarios where IBM BAW can be the best choice:
Workflows with potential to grow medium to large in size with high level of complexity.
Hybrid types of integration needs, integration heavy projects.
Large user base to be served by the solution
Task management features required (Flexible Task Routing, Task Segregation, Task focused custom interfaces, Granular Team Filtering & Assignment)...

Use Cases
​
Automation of common tasks in graphical user interfaces in line of business systems. Deterministic, rules-based automation (current)
