Recommended interactive computing environment for Python programmers especially for data science/machine learning/visualization projects.
Notes
​
Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating notebook documents for programming languages including Julia, Python and R. JupyterLab is a newer user interface for Project Jupyter and offers the building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook in a flexible user interface. Both Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab are free and open source. You can install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab on your local Windows or Mac computer or access JupyterHub (
https://hpc.am.lilly.com/index.php/JupyterHub
) hosted on Lilly High Performance Computing (

Template-driven Natural Language Generation (NLG) platform positioned for enterprise use in targeted functions. As of December 2022, documents in the Clinical and Finance functions (see use cases section) are available, with additional functions (e.g. Science, Marketing, etc.) to be built into the platform over the next 3 years of collaboration (through 2025). Extension to other areas requires development and prioritization. Yseop is not currently positioned for ML/model-driven NLG scenarios. If you have any NLG request, please email the Architect & Contact. They will help you determine the appropriate technology (template-driven vs ML/model-driven), resources and priority.
Use Cases
​
Clinical (Patient Narratives, Clinical Study Reports, Summary of Clinical Safety) and Finance (Monthly Reports)
Notes
​
Yseop is a no code intelligent report automation platform using NLG. The platform is provided as SaaS hosted in AWS and can be integrated with other solutions via existing API's. A Java-based SDK exists for platform extensibility.
