Traditional network monitoring (SNMP, basic ping) only confirms connectivity; it does not reveal performance bottlenecks, security lateral movement, or application transaction latency caused by the network itself. An AI-ready strategy treats the network as a high-fidelity sensor for application behavior and security.\nThe Goal: Move beyond monitoring device health to understanding network behavior and traffic flow, ensuring low-latency delivery of critical business services and providing rich security context.\nThe Three Imperatives for AI-Ready Network Data\nTo unlock advanced use cases like network-based anomaly detection and security investigation, architects must prioritize the collection of high-context, rich network data.\nNetwork Flow Data (NetFlow, IPFIX, V-Flow)\nFlow data reveals who is talking to whom, how much, and for how long. This is crucial for capacity planning, cost allocation, and identifying unexpected traffic patterns.\nRequirement\nWhy it Matters\nActionable Guidance\nComprehensive Coverage\nFlow data must be collected across the entire enterprise (data center, cloud VPCs, and endpoints) to avoid blind spots in east-west traffic.\nMandate flow logging in all cloud environments (VPC Flow Logs) and ensure on-prem network devices (routers/switches) are configured to export NetFlow/IPFIX to a central collector.\nConsistent Aggregation\nOver-aggregating flow data loses granularity needed for forensic analysis and machine learning pattern detection.\nSet flow export timers appropriately (e.g., 60 seconds or less). Use flow analysis tools that retain detailed, unsummarized flow records for at least 30 days.\nHigh-Fidelity Packet Data (The \"Deep Dive\")\nPacket data (or deep packet inspection/DPI) provides the unfiltered, raw ground truth necessary for troubleshooting complex, intermittent latency issues or validating application protocol behavior.\nRequirement\nWhy it Matters\nActionable Guidance\nIntelligent Capture and Storage\nStoring all packets is prohibitively expensive. Only metadata and suspicious packets should be retained long-term.\nDeploy network agents/probes that perform Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to extract application-level metadata (e.g., HTTP response codes, database queries) and only capture/store full packets when triggered by a flow anomaly or security alert.\nDecrypted Insight\nEncrypted traffic prevents analysis. The monitoring solution must be able to view traffic after decryption.\nImplement monitoring points behind load balancers/proxies where TLS decryption has already occurred, or integrate with decryption technologies (e.g., in a cloud environment or using security tools).\nNetwork Metadata & Health (The \"Context\")\nThis category includes SNMP data, device configuration, and synthetic health checks that provide context about the network's state.\nRequirement\nWhy it Matters\nActionable Guidance\nService Dependency Mapping\nNetwork components (firewalls, load balancers) are critical service dependencies and must be mapped to the business service model.\nIntegrate network discovery tools (e.g., NetBrain, network configuration management systems) with your AIOps Service Model to automatically update component relationships.\nAgentless vs. Agent-Based\nUsing the right tool for the job. SNMP is great for device health; agents are great for endpoint performance.\nUse SNMP for core router/switch health (CPU, interface stats). Use lightweight agents on servers for local network latency and throughput tests (synthetic checks).\nArchitectural Decision: The Network Data Collector Strategy\nNetwork data collection demands specialized collectors due to high volume (flows) and processing power requirements (packets). Architects must choose the right collector placement and type.\nComponent\nFunction\nStrategic Placement\nWhy it Matters\nDedicated Flow Collector\nIngests, normalizes, and indexes high-volume NetFlow/IPFIX records.\nCentralized Logging/Analytics Zone\nDecouples flow ingestion from performance of core routing infrastructure.\nDPI/Packet Probe\nPerforms Deep Packet Inspection and extracts application metadata.\nBehind Load Balancers or Critical Network Taps\nRequires high-performance hardware/VMs; placement must be strategic to capture relevant application traffic.\nCloud VPC Flow Logs\nCaptures all internal (east-west) traffic within the cloud boundary.\nIntegrated via Native Cloud Services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob)\nEnsures visibility into internal microservice communication, which is often a blind spot.\nThe \"Single Pane of Network Truth\" Insight\nAvoid maintaining separate tools for flow, packet, and SNMP data. Architect for a single observability platform that can ingest all three data types and use a common correlation key (IP, port, hostname) to link them instantly.\nReal-World Use Cases: Best-Fit Technology\nIntegrating comprehensive network data enables advanced analysis far beyond simple network performance monitoring.\nScenario\nGoal & Business Value\nTechnology Focus\nTroubleshooting Intermittent Latency\nGoal: Prove or disprove that a performance issue is network-related (Faster RCA).\nFocus: Cross-correlation between APM trace data and high-fidelity Packet/DPI metadata to pinpoint the exact hop or network segment introducing delay.\nShadow IT & Security Audit\nGoal: Detect unauthorized internal communication, data exfiltration, or new unknown services (Reduced Security Risk).\nFocus: Machine learning on Flow Data to baseline normal traffic volumes and ports, alerting on sudden spikes or unusual protocol usage (Network Behavioral Analysis).\nBandwidth Hog Identification\nGoal: Proactively manage and allocate network capacity across different business units (Cost Optimization).\nFocus: Analyzing Flow Data aggregated by user, application, or geography to identify top bandwidth consumers and plan network upgrades or traffic shaping.\nVPN/Remote Access Monitoring\nGoal: Ensure a quality experience for remote workers and identify regional ISP or last-mile issues (Improved End-User Experience).\nFocus: Synthetic agents on remote user endpoints performing continuous Network Latency Checks and reporting back to the central monitoring platform.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nobservability\nsolution-guide\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nLog Management & Analytics\nNext\n🧭 Resiliency & Disaster Recovery\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
