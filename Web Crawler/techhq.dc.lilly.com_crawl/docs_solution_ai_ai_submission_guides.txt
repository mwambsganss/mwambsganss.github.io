Data Flow Diagram
​
Purpose:
Show different scenarios of how data and requests flow through your system. For GenAI solutions, this tells the story of
what happens when users interact with the system
- which agents, LLM chains, knowledge bases, and tools connect together to serve specific inputs/outputs.
When to include:
User interaction scenarios
(chat query, document upload, API request)
Data pipeline scenarios
(ETL, batch processing, real-time streams)
Complex workflows
with multiple paths or decision points
Choose the style that best fits your scenario:
Sequence diagram
for temporal/step-by-step flows (best for user interactions)
Graph diagram
for spatial/branching flows (best for showing multiple paths)
For GenAI/Agentic solutions:
See
GenAI Workflow Diagram
subsection below for specialized agent interaction patterns.
📋 Requirements Checklist & Color Guide
Checklist:
Choose 1-3 key scenarios to document (e.g., "User asks a question", "Batch data ingestion")
Show which components from C1 are involved
For GenAI: show which agents, LLMs, KBs, and tools are used
Label decision points (routing logic, validation gates)
Include data formats at key stages
Show error/exception paths
Add timing or volume annotations where relevant

(supervisor → worker agents)
What to show:
Each agent's name, role, and responsibilities
Tools available to each agent (search, calculator, SQL, API calls)
Which LLM(s) each agent uses
Communication patterns (sequential, parallel, hierarchical, collaborative)
State management and memory (conversation history, shared state)
Decision points (routing logic, delegation, escalation)
📋 Requirements Checklist & Color Guide
Checklist:
Show all agents with clear roles (e.g., "Research Agent", "Code Agent", "Validator")
List tools each agent can use (e.g., "Vector Search", "SQL Query", "Web Search")
Indicate which LLM(s) each agent uses (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, etc.)

Key Documentation Points:
Agent Roles & Responsibilities:
Agent 1 (Supervisor): Routes queries, orchestrates workflow, decides which agents to invoke
Agent 2 (Researcher): Performs vector search, web search, returns relevant context
Agent 3 (Analyst): Analyzes data, generates insights, creates visualizations
LLM Selection Rationale:
GPT-4o for fast routing and classification (low latency)
Claude 3.5 for long-context research and generation (200K window)
Tool Usage:
Vector Search (Pinecone): Semantic search over knowledge base
Python REPL: Execute code for calculations, data transformations
SQL Query: Structured data retrieval from PostgreSQL
State Management:
Shared state stores conversation history and intermediate outputs
Agents read/write to shared state for coordination
State persisted in Redis for session continuity
Handoff Logic:
Supervisor evaluates query complexity → routes to appropriate agent
Agents can invoke other agents when needed (e.g., Researcher → Analyst)
Maximum 3 agent hops to prevent infinite loops

Retention & Deletion
Policy by data type (raw: 30d, processed: 90d, outputs: 2y, logs: 7y), deletion process, archival strategy
Compliance
Frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, GxP), security controls (Auth, monitoring, DLP, scanning), assessments completed
Vendor Due Diligence
Certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001), DPA/BAA in place, audit rights, incident response SLA
📋 Critical Questions for AI Solutions
Training Data:
Is Lilly data used for model training? If yes: What data? How anonymized? Who has access?
Is Lilly data used for RAG/retrieval? If yes: How chunked/embedded? Access controls?
Are models fine-tuned on Lilly data? If yes: Where hosted? Who can access?
Prompts & Responses:
Are user prompts stored? If yes: Where? How long? Who accesses?
Are AI responses stored? If yes: Retention policy?
Are prompts/responses sent to third-party LLM providers? Zero-retention agreements?
How long is conversation history maintained? Where is state stored?
Compliance (for regulated data or external exposure):

What security controls are in place? (Azure AD, MFA, RBAC, monitoring, DLP)
Has a cyber risk assessment been completed?
Has legal counsel reviewed data practices?
Evaluation & Validation
​
Description for Evaluation & Validation.
Document performance measurement and output validation:
Category
What to Document
Ground Truth
How created (human annotation, expert review, gold standard comparison), who creates it, sample size, maintenance
Accuracy Metrics
Classification: precision/recall/F1. Generation: BLEU/ROUGE. RAG: context relevance/faithfulness. Domain-specific metrics
Performance Metrics
Response time (p50/p95/p99), throughput (req/sec), availability (SLA), cost efficiency
User Experience
Satisfaction (ratings/NPS), task completion rate, engagement, error rate
Baseline Comparison
Current state without AI, manual process time, existing system performance
Human-in-the-Loop
Who validates (experts, users)? When (100%, sample %, confidence-triggered)? Review workflow? Feedback capture?
Automated Validation
Confidence scoring, semantic validation (second LLM), rule-based checks (format, logic, safety), test suites
Feedback Loops
Collection (thumbs up/down, corrections, flags), processing (aggregation, labeling), model improvement (prompt refinement, fine-tuning, RAG optimization)
Monitoring
Real-time dashboards, drift detection, alerting rules (error spikes, latency increases), incident response
Validation Frequency
Pre-deployment testing, continuous production monitoring, periodic reviews (monthly/quarterly), post-change regression tests
📋 ML Optimization Strategies
Feedback Collection:
User feedback: Thumbs up/down, star ratings, corrections, flags
Implicit feedback: Click-through rates, time spent, task completion
System logs: Error logs, performance metrics, usage patterns
Model Improvement:
Prompt refinement: A/B test different prompts based on feedback
Fine-tuning: How often? (weekly/monthly/quarterly) What's the pipeline?
RAG optimization: Improve chunking, embedding model, ranking algorithms
Agent optimization: Adjust responsibilities, retrain routing, update tool usage
Monitoring & Alerting:

Drift detection for data/model degradation
Alert triggers: Error rate spike, latency increase, quality drop
Incident response process when quality degrades
Usage Tips
​
Start minimal
- Copy starter templates and fill in your specifics
Reference exemplars
- See complete examples in the exemplar files
Remove what doesn't apply
- Not every solution needs all sections
Keep it current
- Update as architecture evolves
Use tables
- For requirements and checklists (more scannable)
Link to detailed docs
- Don't overload this template, reference separate docs
