ServiceNow Knowledge Base
​
ServiceNow’s Knowledge Base enables organizations to capture, structure, and reuse knowledge efficiently. It supports
the creation of how-to articles, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides, helping users solve problems independently and
reducing the burden on IT support teams. The platform promotes continuous improvement through feedback and article
linking, making it a dynamic and evolving knowledge
repository.

Stack Overflow Enterprise
​
Stack Overflow Enterprise enhances internal collaboration by allowing developers and technical teams to ask questions,
share answers, and document solutions in a structured, searchable format. It reduces duplicated efforts, accelerates
onboarding, and integrates with tools like Slack and Teams to bring knowledge into the flow of
work.

Microsoft Teams
​
Microsoft Teams serves as a central hub for teamwork, combining chat, meetings, file sharing, and app integration. It
facilitates real-time collaboration and knowledge sharing across departments, enabling users to co-author documents and
access shared knowledge seamlessly. Teams also integrates with Microsoft Search and Copilot to surface relevant
information contextually.

Microsoft SharePoint
​
SharePoint provides a structured platform for managing and sharing content, knowledge, and applications. It supports
document libraries, metadata tagging, and version control, making it ideal for building intranet portals and knowledge
bases. SharePoint’s integration with Microsoft 365 ensures that knowledge is accessible and governed across the
organization).

Microsoft Stream in SharePoint
​
Microsoft Stream (on SharePoint) transforms video into a first-class knowledge asset. It allows users to record, upload,
and share videos like training sessions and meeting recaps, with features like transcripts, chapters, and AI-powered
search. This makes video content as accessible and manageable as documents, enhancing visual knowledge
sharing.

Atlassian Confluence
​
Confluence is a collaborative workspace that enables teams to create, organize, and share knowledge through
open-by-default pages and spaces. It supports real-time editing, integrates with Jira, and fosters a culture of
transparency and continuous improvement. Confluence is especially effective for project documentation and
cross-functional collaboration.

GitHub
​
GitHub supports knowledge sharing through version-controlled repositories, wikis, and pull requests. It enables
developers to document code, share best practices, and collaborate on projects transparently. Pull requests facilitate
peer review and iterative improvement, embedding knowledge sharing directly into the development workflow.

Facebook Docusaurus
​
Docusaurus is a static site generator tailored for technical documentation. It allows teams to build fast, customizable,
and versioned documentation websites using Markdown and React. Ideal for developer portals and product docs, Docusaurus
supports multilingual content, search, and integration with CI/CD pipelines, making it a powerful tool for structured
knowledge dissemination.
