Overview
​
The AI Architecture Ecosystem is the primary tool for making AI technology decisions at Lilly. It defines the layers
(the stack), capabilities, and platforms that are approved for use.
The ecosystem, and supporting documentation, is created and maintained by ML/AI experts. The framework represents a
comprehensive reconciliation of existing Lilly AI services, external AI benchmarking, and emerging AI technologies
appropriate for applying in the pharmaceutical industry. As new capabilities and features are identified, the framework
is updated accordingly.
AI Architecture Layers
The AI Architecture Ecosystem consists of the following layers:
AI Architecture Layers
Experience Layer
Human interfaces for AI-enabled products where users are
↑
AI Layer
Re-usable deterministic and probabilistic AI capabilities
↑
Model Layer
Commercial ML capabilities with common controls and MLOps
↑
Data Layer
Vector databases, semantic layers, and synthetic data
Experience Layer
- Consistent human interfaces for bringing AI-enabled products to meet
users and customers where they are.
AI Layer
- Re-usable capabilities merging deterministic and probabilistic AI approaches; accessible
to local engineers.
Model Layer
- Leading commercial and strategic capabilities for probabilistic approaches,
providing common controls, MLOps, and LLMOps features.
Data Layer
- AI-enabled and enabling capabilities, such as data products, vector databases,
semantic layers, and synthetic data.
Each layer is detailed in its own document, accessible via the links above.
