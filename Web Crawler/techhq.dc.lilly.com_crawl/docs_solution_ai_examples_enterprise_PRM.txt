The PRM Process
​
The Press Release Miner follows a structured six-step process to generate comprehensive briefing documents:
Develop a research plan
: The system begins by analyzing the research topic and developing a strategic plan for gathering information. This includes identifying key factors and questions that need to be addressed.
Search internal press releases
: PRM leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to search through Eli Lilly's internal press releases, extracting relevant information and insights.
Search web for news sources
: The system extends its research to external sources, searching trusted news outlets and websites for additional context and information.
Conduct follow-up research
: Based on initial findings, PRM performs deeper, targeted research to fill knowledge gaps and answer specific questions that arise.
Synthesize research results
: The system integrates information from multiple sources, removing duplicates and organizing content into a coherent structure with proper citations.
Generate briefing document
: Finally, PRM produces a well-formatted briefing document that adheres to Eli Lilly's language and style guidelines.
This entire process is orchestrated through approximately 50 LLM calls, distributed across various agents and tools within the system.
System Architecture
​
PRM's architecture consists of four main components: UI interfaces, specialized agents, tools, and data sources. These components work together to create a seamless research and content generation pipeline.
UI Components
​
Research Topic
: Interface for users to input the main subject for research
Research Factors
: Display and selection of key aspects to investigate
Human Interaction
: Interface for user feedback and guidance during the research process
Briefing Document
: Final output display with the generated content
Agents
​
PRM employs four specialized agents, each with distinct responsibilities:
Research Planner (Contextualization Agent)
: Responsible for understanding the research topic, breaking it down into manageable components, and developing a comprehensive research strategy. This agent provides the overall direction for the research process.
Researcher (Research Agent/CoT/ToT)
: The primary information gathering agent that executes the research plan. It utilizes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning to conduct thorough investigations across multiple sources.
Synthesizer (Interview/Q&A Agent)
: Processes and integrates the collected information, identifying patterns, resolving contradictions, and organizing content into a coherent narrative. This agent can also generate follow-up questions to fill information gaps.
Copyeditor (Formatting Agent)
: Ensures the final document adheres to Eli Lilly's style guidelines, maintains consistent formatting, and includes proper citations for all information sources.
Tools
​
The agents leverage several tools to perform their tasks:
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
: Enables semantic search across internal documents, retrieving relevant information based on context rather than just keywords.
Web Search
: Interfaces with search engines (primarily Bing) to gather information from trusted external sources.
YouTube
: Extracts information from video content, particularly from news channels and official company presentations.
Wikipedia
: Provides background information and context for topics and entities mentioned in the research.
Data Sources
​
PRM accesses both internal and external data sources:
Internal Data Sources
:
Lilly Press Releases
Earnings Call Transcripts
Prior Briefing Documents
External Data Sources
:
News Journals (NYT, WP, WSJ, etc.)

Agentic Patterns in PRM
​
The Press Release Miner implements several sophisticated agentic patterns that enable effective coordination, parallel processing, and specialized task execution. These patterns represent the cutting edge of multi-agent system design and contribute significantly to PRM's effectiveness.
Multi-Agent Coordination
​
PRM's architecture demonstrates how multiple specialized agents can work together to accomplish complex tasks. The system implements a coordination mechanism that allows agents to:
Share context
: Agents pass information and context to each other, ensuring continuity throughout the research process.
Sequential processing
: The Research Planner sets the direction, followed by the Researcher gathering information, the Synthesizer integrating it, and finally the Copyeditor formatting the output.
Feedback loops
: Agents can request additional information or clarification from other agents when needed, creating a dynamic research process.
This coordination pattern enables each agent to focus on its specialized task while contributing to the overall goal of producing a comprehensive briefing document.
Tool Usage Patterns
​
PRM implements three distinct tool usage patterns across its agents:
Tool Calling Pattern
: The system uses a structured approach for agents to invoke tools, with clear input/output specifications. This pattern is implemented in
tool_calling_tool.py
, which creates a runnable agent that can use multiple tools based on a system template and human instructions.
function tool_calling_runnable(tool_runtime):
Initialize system template from tool_runtime
Copy and initialize tools from tool_runtime
For each tool:
Add tool name and description to system template
Create prompt template with system template, human template, and agent scratchpad
Create tool-calling agent with LLM, tools, and prompt
Return agent executor with configured agent and tools
ReAct Pattern (Reasoning and Acting)
: PRM implements the ReAct pattern in
react_tool.py
, allowing agents to alternate between reasoning about their next steps and taking actions. This pattern enhances the agent's ability to plan and execute complex research tasks.
function react_agent_runnable(tool_runtime):
Copy and initialize tools from tool_runtime
Create prompt from react template
Create ReAct agent with LLM, tools, and prompt
Return agent executor with configured agent and tools
Self-Ask Pattern
: Implemented in
self_ask_tool.py
, this pattern enables agents to break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions, answer them sequentially, and then synthesize a final answer. This is particularly useful for complex research topics that require multi-step reasoning.
function self_ask_runnable(tool_runtime):
Copy tools from tool_runtime
Select first tool and rename it to "Intermediate Answer"
Create prompt from self-ask template
Create self-ask agent with LLM, tool, and prompt
Return agent executor with configured agent and tool
Parallel Processing
​
One of PRM's most powerful features is its ability to conduct research on multiple topics or factors simultaneously. This is implemented through the
parallelization_tool.py
, which enables:
Concurrent tool execution
: Multiple tools can be executed in parallel across different research topics.
Asynchronous processing
: The system uses Python's asyncio to manage concurrent tasks efficiently.
Result aggregation
: Results from parallel processes are collected and integrated into a coherent output.
async function async_parallel_tool_call(topics, tool_runtime, id_task, target):
Create queue for communication
Create empty tasks list
For each topic:
Create async task for processing topic and add to tasks list
While true:
Get item from queue
Yield item to caller
Mark task as done
If all tasks are done and queue is empty:
Break loop
Await all tasks to complete
This parallel processing capability significantly reduces the time required to conduct comprehensive research across multiple topics or factors.
Agent Specialization and Collaboration
​
PRM demonstrates how specialized agents can collaborate effectively to produce high-quality outputs. Each agent has a specific role:
Research Pipeline Agent
: Orchestrates the overall research process, managing the flow of information between other agents and tools.
class ResearchPipeline:
function __init__(llm, bing_subscription_key, retriever, templates, etc):
Store all parameters as instance variables
Initialize tools array with web search, RAG, and other tools
Create dictionary of agent runnables (simple, react, self-ask)
Initialize tool runtime configuration
async function research_question(target, agent_type):
Select appropriate agent type
For each event from parallel tool execution:
Yield event to caller
async function research_question_with_factors(target, topics, format_section_prompt, remove_duplicates_prompt, agent_type):
Select appropriate agent type
Process research results in parallel
Format and deduplicate results
Yield final output
Formatting Agent
: Specializes in ensuring consistent formatting and removing duplicates across research outputs.
class FormatResearchAgent:
function __init__(llm):
Store LLM as instance variable
async function async_format_section(research_output, format_section_prompt):
Find reference text with maximum length
Create formatting instruction with reference and candidate texts
Create formatting chain with LLM
Process each research output for uniform formatting
Return formatted outputs
async function async_remove_duplicates(research_output, remove_duplicates_prompt):
Create deduplication instruction template
Create deduplication chain with LLM
Compare each pair of research outputs
Remove duplicate information
Return deduplicated outputs
Brainstorming Agent
: Generates research factors and questions to guide the research process.
function brainstorming_agent(brainstorming_prompt_template, llm):
Create prompt template with target variable and max 5 items limit
Create LLM chain with prompt and LLM
Return the chain for generating research factors
This specialization allows each agent to focus on what it does best while contributing to the overall system goal.
Technical Implementation
​
LLM Integration
​
PRM integrates with Azure OpenAI's GPT-4o model to power its agents. The system makes approximately 50 LLM calls throughout the research and content generation process, distributed across various agents and tasks. The LLM integration is managed through a custom model class that handles authentication and API interactions with Azure OpenAI services and AWS resources.
Technologies Used
​
PRM leverages several key technologies:
LangChain
: Used extensively for agent creation, tool integration, and prompt management. LangChain provides the foundation for the agentic patterns implemented in PRM.
FastAPI
: Powers the backend API, providing WebSocket endpoints for real-time communication during the research process.
FAISS
: Implements the vector store for efficient semantic search across internal documents.
Azure OpenAI
: Provides the LLM capabilities that power the agents' reasoning and content generation.
Bing Search API
: Enables web search functionality for gathering information from external sources.
Prompt Engineering
​
Prompt engineering is a critical aspect of PRM's implementation. The system uses carefully crafted prompts to guide each agent's behavior and ensure high-quality outputs. For example:
Research Agent Prompt
: Guides the research process with specific instructions for gathering comprehensive information:
# The research agent prompt instructs the agent to gather detailed information with proper citations, format responses with chronological ordering and bulleted lists, and ensure all facts are properly attributed to their sources.
Formatting Agent Prompt
: Ensures consistent formatting and structure across research outputs:
# The formatting agent prompt guides the agent to combine research outputs from multiple sources into a cohesive document, maintain proper citations for all facts and figures, and structure the content with appropriate headings and subheadings.
De-duplication Prompt
: Removes redundant information across research outputs:
# The de-duplication prompt instructs the agent to compare reference and candidate texts, remove duplicate facts, quotes, and figures from the candidate text, and ensure the final output has no redundant information while maintaining coherent flow.
These prompts are critical for guiding the agents' behavior and ensuring they produce outputs that meet Eli Lilly's standards for quality and consistency.
Quality Control Mechanisms
​
PRM implements several quality control mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and consistency of its outputs:
Uniform Formatting
: The FormatResearchAgent ensures consistent formatting across all research outputs:
async function async_format_section(research_output, format_section_prompt):
Create async queue for communication
Find reference topic with longest text
Create formatting instruction template
Create formatting chain with LLM
For each topic and text:
If not reference topic:
Create task to format candidate text
Else:
Add to output without formatting
Process queue until all tasks complete
Return formatted research outputs
De-duplication
: Removes redundant information across research outputs:
async function async_remove_duplicates(research_output, remove_duplicates_prompt):
Create async queue for communication
Create deduplication instruction template
Create deduplication chain with LLM
Track processed pairs to avoid duplicate work
For each reference topic/text pair:
For each candidate topic/text pair:
If not same topic and not already processed:
Create task to deduplicate candidate text
Mark pair as processed
Else:
Add to output without deduplication
Process queue until all tasks complete
Return deduplicated research outputs
Citation Requirements
: Ensures all information is properly cited with source details:
The system enforces strict citation requirements, ensuring that every fact, figure, date, and quote is properly attributed to its source with a standardized citation format that includes the source name, publication date, headline, and full web address.
These quality control mechanisms ensure that PRM produces outputs that are accurate, well-structured, and properly cited.
