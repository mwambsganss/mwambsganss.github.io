Capability Owner: Manuela Elena García Conde
EBA Lead: Chris Blessing
Contributors & Reviewers: TBD
A guide for selecting and applying specialized NoSQL, graph, in-memory, search, and analytical databases optimized for high-performance, low-latency, and scalable workloads across AWS and Azure platforms.
Avoid using these technologies for traditional OLTP workloads requiring strict ACID compliance across multiple tables.

AWS DynamoDB
​
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service designed for key-value and document data models. It offers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale and is ideal for serverless applications, IoT, gaming, and mobile backends. It integrates tightly with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and IAM for secure, scalable architectures.
Amazon Redshift
​
Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service. It supports complex analytical queries across structured and semi-structured data. Redshift integrates with AWS Glue, S3, and QuickSight for end-to-end analytics pipelines.
Azure Cosmos DB (SQL and Gremlin)
​
Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service. The SQL API supports document-based workloads with rich querying, while the Gremlin API enables graph-based querying for complex relationships. Cosmos DB offers multi-region writes, low-latency reads, and five consistency models.
AWS Neptune
​
Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built graph database optimized for storing and querying highly connected data. It supports both property graph (Gremlin) and RDF (SPARQL) models. Neptune is ideal for knowledge graphs, fraud detection, and recommendation engines.
AWS ElastiCache for Redis
​
AWS ElastiCache for Redis is a fully managed in-memory data store and cache service. It supports sub-millisecond latency and is commonly used for session storage, real-time analytics, and pub/sub messaging.
Azure Cache for Redis
​
Azure Cache for Redis is a fully managed, in-memory cache that enables high-throughput and low-latency data access. It supports Redis data structures and is ideal for caching, session state, and real-time analytics in Azure-hosted applications.
