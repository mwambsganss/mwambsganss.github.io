🤲 TechHQ Contributions
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tech@Lilly’s technical guidance and AI knowledge base — your input is
truly appreciated!
TechHQ embraces a collaborative model inspired by wikis and open source communities. In our case, we follow an
inner source
approach, where everyone is
encouraged to share, improve, and build together across teams.
What should you put on TechHQ?
Technical guidance on TechHQ should be sufficiently complete to aid architects and detailed enough for AI usage. To keep
our technical knowledge DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), avoid repeating content already published elsewhere; instead, link
to important external resources.
Solution Guide Contributions
​
Solution guides are now synced daily from Stack Overflow articles.
To contribute:
Sign up to own a guide in our
TechHQ Solution Guides spreadsheet
, which is on our
TechHQ Teams site
.
Use the
TechHQ Solution Guide Drafter
(Copilot AI) to start your first draft.
Most TechHQ Solution Guides have a Use Case / Technology table;
Container Services
is a good example. Other guides are
simply a high-level overview of what architects should know, such as
Resiliency & Disaster Recovery​
.
Copy the draft markdown into a
new Stack Overflow article
.
For consistency, prefix the guide name with 🧭, and be sure to use the INFO block at the top, as seen in the
Solution Guide Template
.
Add three tags to the article:
techhq
,
solution-guide
, and one the following:
ai
- Guidance for generative AI
and LLMs
business-enablement
-
Guidance for our line-of-business platforms and capabilities, e.g. clinical operations, regulatory, manufacturing,
supply chain, commercial
cloud
- Guidance for cloud
(public, private, IaaS, PaaS, & SaaS)
cybersecurity
- Guidance for
cybersecurity, information security, and security best practices
data
- Guidance for data to
insights guides, analytics, databases, and data science
software-engineering
-
Guidance for CI/CD, automation, infrastructure as code, and deployment practices
