Solution Guide
Lifecycle: Draft

Contributors & Reviewers: TBD
This is a solution guide for Visualization Tools. Visualization tools are powerful software applications that transform
complex data into easy-to-understand visuals, allowing businesses to track relevant key metrics from one centralized,
intuitive interface.
This guide is focused on recommending the
best
tool for each scenario. The features of the most common tech tools
overlap, but we are providing recommendations for best practices at Lilly. These scenarios are targeted at business
analyst type users, looking for a UI-based option to create visuals. Additional tech recommendations for code based
visuals (D3, Plotly, etc.) at Lilly will exist in a separate solution guide.

At the time of this writing, Tableau at Lilly lacks several of the AI related features offered in other tech options.
Due to that, Power BI is recommended over Tableau in cases where both tech options meet the use case need.
