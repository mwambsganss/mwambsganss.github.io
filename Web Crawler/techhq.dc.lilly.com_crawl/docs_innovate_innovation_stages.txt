Pipeline Overview
​
Our Tech Innovation Pipeline is a structured pathway for innovations across Tech@Lilly with focused enablers and
enhanced visibility into the progression of breakthrough technologies and disruptive solutions. The pipeline's five
stages go from Conceptualization to Realization to Scale.
Pre-Alpha
Alpha
Beta
Early Release
General Release
Description
Exploratory stage to discover and define possibilities
Initial development stage to prove feasibility
Initial user feedback stage to guide improvement
Pilot stage; initiate real-world use with controlled risk
Scaling stage; deploying to full intended user base

Pre-Alpha
​
Think of this as the brainstorming stage where we're gathering sketches, wireframes, and maybe even napkin doodles. This
isn't about clarity but about exploring and sharing potential. It’s more than just an idea.
Definition
Pre-alpha is the EXPLORATORY stage centered around technological and experiential possibilities. The clarity of the
innovation's potential is still evolving, and it includes diverse artifacts and research materials. The pre-alpha stage
is where an idea becomes a fledgling innovation with investigative work that discovers signals of feasibility,
desirability, and/or viability.
Purpose
The goal of this stage is to gather and communicate ideas, identify potential features, and validate core concepts. It
sets the groundwork for the upcoming, more defined stages of development.
Examples

DocIT Submission
Alpha
​
Now, we're onto building a rough draft or prototype. It might be a piece of software, a design blueprint, or another
kind of tangible representation. It's not complete and its OK to have glitches or missing parts, but it's the first real
look at our innovation. The primary objective here? Refine our vision, iron out the kinks, and prepare for the stages
ahead.
Definition
Alpha is the stage where the innovation takes its first TANGIBLE form. This may be functional software or a UX design
that has a fair degree of fidelity, but neither are usually ‘feature-complete’. It is usually tested internally within
the team involved in the early stages. It likely has bugs and incomplete features.
Purpose
The primary goal of the alpha stage is to identify key features and begin to define Product scope, strategy and vision
more closely with a demo. This stage allows for rapid testing of the product's functionality with primary stakeholders
and serves as a preparation for the beta stage, where a larger contingent of resources and people are be needed to
advance it further.
Examples
​
RocIT Alpha
DocIT Alpha
Beta
​
We're getting there! Our innovation is now usable for a small audience but might still have a few rough edges. We are
ready to provide it to a select group of users and gather their feedback. Their insights will be crucial in making sure
our product isn't just functional, but also user- friendly and ready for a larger set of users.
Definition
Beta is the stage where the innovation is ready to be used for its primary intended purpose. It is the first time the
innovation is provided to a select group of users in a controlled environment. A beta release provides the stability
required for end users to regularly exercise functionality with minimal disruption but does not guarantee service levels
or support agreements.
Purpose
The purpose of the beta stage is to gather FEEDBACK from real-world users who can identify major bugs, usability issues,
or other potential problems that were not apparent during the alpha stage. This helps ensure the product is becoming a
valuable solution heading for Early Release.
Examples
​
RocIT Beta
DocIT Beta
Early Release
​
Consider this a trial run. Before we go all out, we try our innovation in a limited, real-world setting. When the stakes
are high, it's a smart move to ensure the technology and processes are ready to scale.
Definition
Early Release is the CONFIRMATION stage where the innovation is tried in a limited real- world, supported environment.
Early Release limits risk when a product’s intended vision and scale includes a very large number of users/customers or
could negatively impact business functions if unforeseen challenges arise. This stage establishes a market test of an
innovation to help justify the larger investment needed to achieve full scale.
Purpose
The purpose of the Early Release stage is to ensure we are ready to scale. It validates the product's functionality,
usability, and reliability in a real-world setting before it is released to a larger audience. We learn from data to
inform decisions and ensure scalability. This stage allows for the identification and resolution of operational issues
before scaling to the full intended user/customer base.
General Release
​
Time to roll out! Our innovation is ready to face the world. It's polished, tested, and has the stamp of approval. From
here on, our focus pivots from initial innovation to promotion, continuous improvements, and a roadmap of future
features and capabilities.
Definition
General Release marks the official introduction of the innovation to its full intended audience, whether that's a
department, the entire company, or the broader public. At this point, the innovation is fully supported and equipped to
SCALE.
Purpose
The purpose of the General Release stage is to achieve the value promised by the innovation framework.
