:::warning
Avoid ingesting unfiltered, unstructured logs into your analytics platform. This leads to high costs, poor performance, and unusable data for AI models.

## Why This Matters: From Dumb Storage to Smart Context
Traditional log management focused on storing raw text for compliance. Today, logs must be structured, correlated, and enriched to support real-time diagnostics, RCA, and predictive analytics. A modern log strategy transforms high-volume, unstructured data into low-latency, high-value insights.
---
## The Three Imperatives for AI-Ready Logs
### 1. Structured Ingestion (The "Parser")
:::info[Structured Logging]
- Enforce JSON or key-value format at the source (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J)
- Mandate NTP synchronization across all hosts
- Use ISO 8601 timestamps with timezone offsets
:::
### 2. Intelligent Routing & Filtering (The "Pipeline")
:::info[Smart Pipelines]
- Filter debug/heartbeat logs at the edge using DSP or Fluent Bit
- Route high-value logs (e.g., security events) to long-term indexes
- Use short-term, low-cost storage for transient logs
:::
### 3. Cross-Domain Correlation (The "Link")
:::info[Unified Correlation]
- Tag all logs with host_id, service_name, and trace_id
- Enrich logs with CMDB metadata (e.g., environment, owner, tier)
- Enable one-click pivot between metrics and logs in observability platforms

:::tip[Process Near the Source]
Place filtering and structuring logic in the collector or forwarder to reduce bandwidth and indexing load.

## Technology Details
### Splunk Enterprise + DSP
Strategic platform for enterprise-wide log analytics. DSP enables edge filtering, enrichment, and routing. Deep integration with ITSI and CMDB supports RCA and AIOps.
### Splunk SIEM
Standard platform for security log analytics. Supports long-term retention, forensic investigation, and compliance reporting. Integrates with syslog, Windows Event Logs, and audit frameworks.
### Fluentd + Databricks
Specialized solution for business activity monitoring. Fluentd collects structured logs; Databricks transforms them into metrics for dashboarding and analysis.
### ELK Stack
Standard open-source stack for developer debugging and QA. Elasticsearch indexes logs; Logstash parses and routes; Kibana visualizes. Ideal for CI/CD pipelines.
### Amazon S3 + Athena
Cost-effective solution for long-term log retention. Fluent Bit routes logs to S3; Athena enables SQL-based querying. Best for low-frequency access and compliance storage.

### Recommendations to Improve Guide Usability
1. **Add Architecture Diagrams** showing the log pipeline from source to analytics platform.
2. **Include Deployment Playbooks** for agent rollout, DSP configuration, and index setup.
3. **Link to Governance Policies** for log retention, security, and compliance.
