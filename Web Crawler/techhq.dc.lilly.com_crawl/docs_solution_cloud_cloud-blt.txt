Security enforcement and Life Cycle Management for serverless (AWS lambda) APIs, within the constraints of
LCS-517 Appropriate Use of Lilly Public Cloud Environments
.  Specifically: APIs whose backend lambdas run within a DX VPC must be
private
.
Use Cases
​
APIs built on serverless (lambda) technology with a single consistent authentication pattern.  Requires AWS technical and lambda coding expertise.
Project teams are responsible for all support; no enterprise service provided.
Teams can ask questions on Lilly Flow.
Notes
​
Authentication must be enforced, even for private APIs.  The strength of the authentication should be commiserate with the sensitivity of the data/functionality provided by the API.  When in doubt, consult with your

AWS Paas solution to index and search large amount of data. Use for pinpoint search cases rather than data exploration and analytics.
Use Cases
​
This is used for log management; kibana dashboard is integrated with this service used for monitoring and visualization. keyword-based search with synonyms/hierarchy for multiple data sources (SP, Regulus, DCTM) with custom UI or Kibanakeyword-based search on a custom-built Heroku app with a Contentful backendSearch Business Specific Content without giving access to the data (Cue)General purpose searchUnstructured search
Notes
​
ElasticSearch is the core search technology underpinning Anzo and Watson explorer.  When there is no need for semantics or analytics stand-alone ElasticSearch is a more managable and small footprint approach.Available in multiple platforms and implementation patterns Very customizable search experience based on the app contentBased on an open API - consumable from any API-centric data sourceCaution: Can require some complex configuration. Â We do not have dedicated vendor for integrations

AWS Batch helps you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure, similar to traditional batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly.

CAST review on 02-May-2024. Jarrett Meyer was approved to move forward with a request to Enterprise Data for a POC of this with one of his applications.  This service is not centrally managed or supported.  Teams wishing to use the service within their AWS account should ensure that they do not grant access to lookout objects those who they wouldn't grant access to the underlying sources being analyzed.  Additionally, if you wish to export the lookout objects anywhere engage your BISO so that a Cyber Cloud Security Architecture and Engineering assessment can done prior to enabling the export.
