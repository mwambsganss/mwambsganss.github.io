This\nisn't about clarity but about exploring and sharing potential. It’s more than just an idea.\nDefinition\nPre-alpha is the EXPLORATORY stage centered around technological and experiential possibilities. The clarity of the\ninnovation's potential is still evolving, and it includes diverse artifacts and research materials. The pre-alpha stage\nis where an idea becomes a fledgling innovation with investigative work that discovers signals of feasibility,\ndesirability, and/or viability.\nPurpose\nThe goal of this stage is to gather and communicate ideas, identify potential features, and validate core concepts. It\nsets the groundwork for the upcoming, more defined stages of development.\nExamples\n​\nRocIT Submission\nDocIT Submission\nAlpha\n​\nNow, we're onto building a rough draft or prototype. It might be a piece of software, a design blueprint, or another\nkind of tangible representation. It's not complete and its OK to have glitches or missing parts, but it's the first real\nlook at our innovation. The primary objective here? Refine our vision, iron out the kinks, and prepare for the stages\nahead.\nDefinition\nAlpha is the stage where the innovation takes its first TANGIBLE form. This may be functional software or a UX design\nthat has a fair degree of fidelity, but neither are usually ‘feature-complete’. It is usually tested internally within\nthe team involved in the early stages. It likely has bugs and incomplete features.\nPurpose\nThe primary goal of the alpha stage is to identify key features and begin to define Product scope, strategy and vision\nmore closely with a demo. This stage allows for rapid testing of the product's functionality with primary stakeholders\nand serves as a preparation for the beta stage, where a larger contingent of resources and people are be needed to\nadvance it further.\nExamples\n​\nRocIT Alpha\nDocIT Alpha\nBeta\n​\nWe're getting there! Our innovation is now usable for a small audience but might still have a few rough edges. We are\nready to provide it to a select group of users and gather their feedback. Their insights will be crucial in making sure\nour product isn't just functional, but also user- friendly and ready for a larger set of users.\nDefinition\nBeta is the stage where the innovation is ready to be used for its primary intended purpose. It is the first time the\ninnovation is provided to a select group of users in a controlled environment. A beta release provides the stability\nrequired for end users to regularly exercise functionality with minimal disruption but does not guarantee service levels\nor support agreements.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the beta stage is to gather FEEDBACK from real-world users who can identify major bugs, usability issues,\nor other potential problems that were not apparent during the alpha stage. This helps ensure the product is becoming a\nvaluable solution heading for Early Release.\nExamples\n​\nRocIT Beta\nDocIT Beta\nEarly Release\n​\nConsider this a trial run. Before we go all out, we try our innovation in a limited, real-world setting. When the stakes\nare high, it's a smart move to ensure the technology and processes are ready to scale.\nDefinition\nEarly Release is the CONFIRMATION stage where the innovation is tried in a limited real- world, supported environment.\nEarly Release limits risk when a product’s intended vision and scale includes a very large number of users/customers or\ncould negatively impact business functions if unforeseen challenges arise. This stage establishes a market test of an\ninnovation to help justify the larger investment needed to achieve full scale.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the Early Release stage is to ensure we are ready to scale. It validates the product's functionality,\nusability, and reliability in a real-world setting before it is released to a larger audience. We learn from data to\ninform decisions and ensure scalability. This stage allows for the identification and resolution of operational issues\nbefore scaling to the full intended user/customer base.\nGeneral Release\n​\nTime to roll out! Our innovation is ready to face the world. It's polished, tested, and has the stamp of approval. From\nhere on, our focus pivots from initial innovation to promotion, continuous improvements, and a roadmap of future\nfeatures and capabilities.\nDefinition\nGeneral Release marks the official introduction of the innovation to its full intended audience, whether that's a\ndepartment, the entire company, or the broader public. At this point, the innovation is fully supported and equipped to\nSCALE.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the General Release stage is to achieve the value promised by the innovation framework.\nExamples\n​\nCSA Launchpad Demo\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\ninnovation\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n💡 Tech@Lilly Innovation Pipeline\nNext\n🏎️ Fast Start\nPipeline Overview\nPre-Alpha\nExamples\nAlpha\nExamples\nBeta\nExamples\nEarly Release\nGeneral Release\nExamples\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
