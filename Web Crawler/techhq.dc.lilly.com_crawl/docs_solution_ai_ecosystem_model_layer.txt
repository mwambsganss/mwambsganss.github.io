CATS
Kubed
​
Cloud infrastructure to deploy Lilly external applications
Platform
:
Kubed
MagTrain
​
Dedicated GPU/HPC cluster with secure data enclaves and ML-optimized storage, orchestrated for heavy model-training jobs
Operation Component
​
Model Eval
​
Continuous evaluation and benchmarking of models against curated pharma tasks & public datasets, tracking drift, bias, and performance regressions over versions
Live Guardrails
​
Cortex-Guard: In-line governance hooks that intercept prompts, responses, and data flows to enforce policy checks, PII masking, and security controls before content reaches end users
Red Teaming
​
Structured adversarial testing that bombards models and agents with malicious or edge-case inputs to surface vulnerabilities and measure robustness
Detection Guardrails
​
Batch service that scans data for AE/PC, toxicity, bias, or policy violations, issuing explainable reports and remediation guidance
