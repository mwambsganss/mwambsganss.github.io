It’s been an eventful few months since our February updates roll-up! The TechHQ platform has evolved significantly with
major additions to our AI architecture ecosystem, enhanced innovation pipeline framework, and expanded solution guide
library. Here's what's new this summer:
The highlight is the launch of our
AI Architecture Ecosystem
, authored by the EBA AI Architecture
team. This framework introduces a four-layer stack—Experience, AI, Model, and Data—along with reusable agentic AI
patterns and memory architectures. We’ve also clarified our strategic AI platform positioning, with Cortex as our
primary GenAI platform.
The
Innovation Pipeline
is now easier to navigate thanks to a new Innovation Stage
Assessment Table, helping teams define and assess the maturity of their work—from Pre-Alpha to General Release. Several
capabilities are currently in Pre-Alpha, including AI chatbot testing, automated test script generation, and mobile and
A/V testing frameworks. We’ve also published our first Emerging Technologies write-up on AI video generation, comparing
platforms and outlining pharma-specific use cases.
We’ve expanded our
Solution Guide Library
with new guides including Knowledge Sharing,
Data Visualization, and Document Processing. Each guide reflects our AI-first approach, with integrated recommendations
for tools like Microsoft Copilot, AI-powered test automation, and enhanced translation services. We’ve also improved
lifecycle management
.
To make all of this easier to explore, we’ve also made improvements to homepage navigation—so you can find what you need
faster. We’d love to hear what you think and what you'd like to see next.
Your contributions
and feedback help shape the
future of TechHQ.
