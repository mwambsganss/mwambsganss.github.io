Backstage
​
Backstage
is a developer portal that centralizes software components, APIs, and documentation. It enhances discoverability and governance by providing a catalog of reusable Lilly APIs and services.
Check out Backstage documentation at the links below:
📚
Entity Catalog
: Search for reusable APIs, Components, and Resources enterprise-wide before trying to rebuild one from scratch.
🚀
Accelerators
: Jumpstart development for a new API, Website, and more using templated code with Lilly best practices built-in.
📚
TechDocs
: Write some markdown and let Backstage host your docs website and integrate it with search on your behalf using the mkdocs framework.
🔍
Search
: All reusable assets added to Lilly Backstage and the matching items from LillyFlow can be found using the Search feature in the sidebar.
📂
Client Code Generation
: Found an API to reuse? Let Backstage generate client side code efficiently with built-in best practices to consume faster.
📊
Platform Insights
: See our estimations for how much time Backstage has saved Lilly developers so far!
‼️ Does your team own some re-usable software? You can add it to the Entity Catalog with our
Catalog Integration Tutorial
in just 3 easy steps!
Azure API Management
​
Enterprise Data provides Azure API Management (APIM) as a global API Gateway service.  Delegate authentication, authorization, and threat protection to APIM so you can focus on your API's functionality and business value.
Check out APIM documentation at the links below:
📚
Platform Overview
: Learn more about the platform and how it fits in solution architectures.
🚀
Getting Started
: Get your APIs published in / secured by Azure APIM.
FastAPI Framework for Building REST APIs
​
FastAPI is a modern Python framework for building high-performance APIs with automatic OpenAPI documentation. It is ideal for lightweight services and microservices.
Features:
Automatic OpenAPI and JSON Schema generation
for documentation and validation
Asynchronous support
using Python’s async/await for high-performance APIs
Type hinting and data validation
with Pydantic for cleaner, safer code
Fast development cycles
with minimal boilerplate and intuitive syntax
Backstage Accelerators
has a FastAPI Template to help you get started with this framework.
Strawberry Framework for Building GraphQL APIs
​
Strawberry is a Python library for building GraphQL APIs using modern Python features like type hints and dataclasses. It simplifies GraphQL schema creation and integrates well with Python-based services. Strawberry is ideal for teams looking to expose flexible, queryable APIs and works seamlessly with Hangar CI/CD and Azure API Management for deployment and monitoring.
Features:
Native support
for Python type hints and dataclasses
Automatic GraphQL schema generation
for documentation and validation
Easy integration
with ASGI frameworks like FastAPI
Backstage Accelerators
has a GraphQL Template to help you get started with this framework.
Deploying APIs at Lilly
​
Our team highly recommmends using the Kubernetes clusters by the
CATS
and
Kubed
teams at Lilly for containerized deployments. These platforms provide enterprise support and have several features making your deployment experience easier and more reliable.
For more information on containerized deployments, see
Container Services
.
COMING SOON: CATS and Lilly Kubed are merging into one platform called
Hangar
.
