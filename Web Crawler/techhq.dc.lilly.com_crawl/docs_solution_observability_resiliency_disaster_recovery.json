This encompasses disaster recovery (DR) capabilities, high availability (HA)\narchitecture, and business continuity planning. Proper resiliency ensures that critical business functions continue\noperating during hardware failures, software issues, network outages, or even catastrophic events. This document\nprovides guidance on determining your application's resiliency requirements based on business criticality and\nimplementing appropriate architectural patterns to achieve the required level of service availability.\nResiliency Design Steps\n​\nAssess Application Criticality\n: Begin by identifying the Business Application CI ID in ServiceNow. Detailed\ninstructions can be found in the\nDetermine Application Criticality document\n.\nThis step is crucial for understanding the criticality of your application within its business context.\nDefine Resiliency Requirements\n: Next, use the\n[Resiliency Tier / Infrastructure Matrix](#resiliency-tier--infrastructure-matrix) below to determine the system's\nresiliency requirements. This will help you identify the necessary measures to ensure your application's availability\nand reliability. You can also refer to the\nResiliency Requirements document\nfor additional detail for your application's tier.\nImplement Resilient Architecture\n: Based on your application's tier, follow the guidelines in the\nResiliency Patterns document\n.\nThis resource provides comprehensive information on building high resiliency for various infrastructure components\nlike VMs, databases, and containers. It also explains different disaster recovery (DR) models, helping you design a\nrobust and fault-tolerant system.\nCritical Systems Governance\n​\nTier 0, Critical Systems and Local HA Manufacturing must follow the governance processes for Critical Systems,\ndocumented here\n.\nResiliency Tier / Infrastructure Matrix\n​\nTier\nCloud\nOn-Prem\nTier 0-A\n[Tier 0-A](#tier-0-a)\nsame as cloud\nTier 0-B\n[Tier 0-B](#tier-0-b)\nsame as cloud\nCritical High\n[Critical High](#critical-high-cloud)\n[Critical High](#critical-high-on-prem)\nCritical Medium\n[Critical Medium](#critical-medium-cloud)\n[Critical Medium](#critical-medium-on-prem)\nCritical Low\n[Critical Low](#critical-low-cloud)\n[Critical Low](#critical-low-on-prem)\nLocal HA Manufacturing\nN/A\n[Local HA Manufacturing](#local-ha-manufacturing)\nAll Other Systems\n[All Other Systems](#all-other-systems)\nsame as cloud\nIf you have a system where you only want a subset of critical recovered after a disaster, rather than the entire app\nrefer to [this section](#critical-data) .\nTier 0-A\n​\nThis tier includes critical applications like authentication and networking. An Active-Active DR model is ideal.\nDR RTO\n: < 1 hour\nDR RPO\n: < 15 minutes\nHigh Availability RTO\n: < 1 hour\nHigh Availability RPO\n: < 15 minutes\nBackups\n: One copy locally, one in a secondary region\nMonitoring\n: Implement monitoring and alerting\nDR Testing\n: Annual tests to ensure recovery within RTO and RPO\nHA Testing\n: Test before production. For Active-Active, DR tests also serve as HA tests\nDR Assessments\n: Periodic assessments for compliance\nTier 0-B\n​\nThis tier includes applications essential for recovering other applications after a disaster, such as backup systems.\nThese have high resiliency requirements, though less stringent than Tier 0-A. If Active-Active is not feasible for DR,\nconsider Warm-Active or Pilot Light models.\nDR RTO\n: < 4 hours\nDR RPO\n: < 15 minutes\nHigh Availability RTO\n: < 2 hours\nHigh Availability RPO\n: < 15 minutes\nBackups\n: One copy locally, one in a secondary region\nMonitoring\n: Implement monitoring and alerting\nDR Testing\n: Annual tests to ensure recovery within RTO and RPO\nHA Testing\n: Test before production.

Pilot Light models are sufficient for these applications.\nDR RTO\n: < 8 hours\nDR RPO\n: < 1 hour\nHigh Availability RTO\n: < 4.5 hours\nHigh Availability RPO\n: < 15 minutes\nBackups\n: One copy locally, one in a secondary region\nMonitoring\n: Implement monitoring and alerting\nDR Testing\n: Annual tests to ensure recovery within RTO and RPO\nHA Testing\n: Test before production.

If\na manufacturing site goes down, only the data at that site is recovered, not a full IT system recovery. Manufacturing\ncannot afford downtime due to component failure, so high availability is essential, typically achieved with dual\ncomputer rooms.\nHigh Availability RTO\n: < 2 hours\nHigh Availability RPO\n: < 0 minutes\nBackups\n: One copy locally, one in a secondary region\nMonitoring\n: Implement monitoring and alerting\nDR Assessments\n: Periodic assessments for compliance\nCritical Data\n​\nIf you have a system that does not need to be brought up immediately after a disaster but contains data needed\nimmediately, refer to the section titled ‘\nSaving data separately from applications\n’ in\nResiliency Patterns\nIf you have a question, you can discuss it with your\nDR Steward\nor send an email to\nresiliency@lists.lilly.com\n.\nAll Other Systems\n​\nAll production systems not covered by the above categories fall into this one. In case of a disaster, these systems will\nbe recovered via backup. This is a best effort process and may take 3-4 months.\nDR RPO\n: < 24 hours\nBackups\n: One copy locally, one in a secondary region\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nobservability\nsolution-guide\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nNetwork Monitoring\nNext\n🚀 Team Productivity\nResiliency Design Steps\nCritical Systems Governance\nResiliency Tier / Infrastructure Matrix\nTier 0-A\nTier 0-B\nCritical High Cloud\nCritical High On-Prem\nCritical Medium Cloud\nCritical Medium On-Prem\nCritical Low Cloud\nCritical Low On-Prem\nLocal HA Manufacturing\nCritical Data\nAll Other Systems\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
