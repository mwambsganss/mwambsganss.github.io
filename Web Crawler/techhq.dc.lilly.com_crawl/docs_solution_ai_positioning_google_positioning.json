While\nmaintaining our dual-cloud strategy with Azure and AWS as primary platforms, we recognize Google's specialized\ncapabilities in advanced AI and other unique business solutions. This document provides guidance on when and how Google\ntechnologies should be evaluated, adopted, and governed within our enterprise architecture.\nStrategic Positioning\n​\nAI Platform\n​\nWe are taking a cloud-agnostic approach to AI at Lilly, with Cortex as our main platform. For a complete view of our AI\nplatform positioning, refer our AI Positioning document. Approved platforms, such as Cortex, should be explored before\nconsidering Google AI capabilities.\nModel Approval Process\n: All AI models must be approved for specific use cases by the Advanced Intelligence team. Models are not blanket approved but rather evaluated and approved based on their technical suitability for individual business requirements and use cases.\nPlease feel free to reach out to your local area architect, the Enterprise AI Architecture team or the Cortex Product team for consult on best path for your solution.\nRequesting New Model Evaluation\n: If there is a Google model that you would like to explore further that is not available in Cortex or LLM Gateway, please reach out to the Advanced Intelligence team to help you evaluate the model for your specific solution and use case.\nDual-Cloud Foundation\n​\nLilly maintains a dual-cloud strategy with Azure and AWS as our primary platforms. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is\npositioned as a specialized solution for specific use cases rather than a third general-purpose hyperscaler.\nPrimary Platforms\n:\nAzure\nand\nAWS\nremain our primary focus for cloud and AI solutions\nEvaluation Process\n:\nAzure\nand\nAWS\nsolutions must be evaluated first before considering Google capabilities\nGoogle's Role\n: Specialized provider for\nunique\nbusiness capabilities.\nKey Google Proprietary Services\n​\nLilly has identified several proprietary Google services that offer unique capabilities aligned with our strategic\nneeds. These services are evaluated and adopted based on their ability to deliver specialized functionality that\ncomplements our existing technology stack.\ninfo\nFor each of these solutions, the business area team/leader will be responsible for local contracting,\ndirect billing, driving appropriate design approvals (e.g. EBA, Cyber, Legal, Privacy, Quality), and ongoing support\nmodel. Teams should expect slower process for these initiatives given the custom nature of the solution and lack of\nenterprise approved patterns.\nVertex AI\n​\nVertex AI is Google Cloud's unified machine learning platform that enables the training and deployment of ML models and\nAI applications at scale.\nKey Features\n: AutoML capabilities, custom model training, MLOps tooling, and model monitoring\nStrategic Value\n: Provides advanced ML capabilities with simplified workflows for data scientists and ML engineers\nUse Cases\n: Predictive analytics, computer vision applications, and specialized ML model deployment\nLilly Strategy Today\n: Not approved for separate implementation. Only can be used as part of an Agentspace\ncontainerized solution with governance approval. (See Agentspace below)\nGemini Models\n​\nGemini represents Google's most advanced multimodal AI models, capable of understanding and generating content across\ntext, code, audio, image, and video.\nKey Features\n: Multimodal capabilities, advanced reasoning, and state-of-the-art performance\nStrategic Value\n: Enables sophisticated AI applications that can process and generate multiple types of content\nUse Cases\n: Complex content generation, multimodal analysis, and advanced reasoning tasks\nLilly Strategy Today\n: Gemini models are available through Cortex with use case limitations. Please contact the\nCortex team to discuss use case specifics. Alternatively, you could leverage the LLM Recommender for available models\nwith strengths comparable with Gemini models:\nhttps://llm-recommender.apps-d.lrl.lilly.com\nAgentSpace\n​\nAgentSpace is Google's platform for building, deploying, and managing AI agents that can perform complex tasks through\nreasoning and tool use.\nKey Features\n: Agent development framework, built-in reasoning capabilities, and tool integration\nStrategic Value\n: Enables the creation of specialized AI agents tailored to specific business processes\nUse Cases\n: Automated workflows, intelligent assistants, and process automation\nLilly Strategy Today\n: AgentSpace is not established as a foundational enterprise service at this time as feature\nsets are similar (and in some cases less mature) than corresponding features in Azure and AWS. For approved business\nuse cases, a containerized deployment of AgentSpace with custom UI is appropriate to enable usage of the broader\nGoogle AI platform capabilities.\nA2A Protocol Positioning\n​\nLilly Strategy Today\n: Lilly is committed to advancing industry standard agent communication protocols and to the\npotential for A2A to be a leading standard for our adoption. Since we are still early days with this standard, we should\nbe cautious in assuming it will address full interoperability in the longer term. Our approach at this time is to\nestablish defined standards within Lilly that leverage A2A as input but also keep us independent.\nAgent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Overview\n​\nA2A is an open protocol developed by Google that enables AI agents built on different platforms to communicate and\ncollaborate effectively.\nKey Features\n: Standardized communication format, capability discovery, and task management\nStrategic Value\n: Facilitates interoperability between agents in a heterogeneous AI ecosystem\nUse Cases\n: Complex workflows requiring multiple specialized agents, cross-platform agent collaboration\nAdditional Information\n: Please see our\nprotocols documentation\nfor more detailed\ninformation and connect with the AI Architecture team with any urgent considerations for your projects.\nGoogle Technology Adoption Framework\n​\nAdvanced Cloud and AI Offerings\n​\nWe have established a Google Cloud Platform Landing Zone to ensure we have capabilities available to support priority\nuse cases. This is not setup for general use and we are not planning on qualifying any additional Google services until\nwe have determined the value/cost benefits to broadening our Cloud and AI footprint.\nGoogle Agents and A2A Protocol\n​\nLilly will strategically leverage Google Agents within our environment where they align with business requirements.\nAgent Integration\n: A2A registered agents will be integrated as qualified agents where applicable\nProtocol Standards\n: Lilly is committed to advancing industry standard agent communication protocols\nA2A Approach\n: While recognizing A2A's potential as a leading standard, we maintain a cautious approach\nInternal Standards\n: We will establish defined standards within Lilly that leverage A2A as input while maintaining\nindependence\nContainerized Business Services\n​\nThe architecture pattern established with tech transfer will serve as our model for other prioritized business value\ninitiatives.\nArchitecture Pattern\n: AgentSpace backend with custom UI, building agents using ADK for Agent Engine\nImplementation Approach\n: Creation of bespoke agents tailored to specific business needs\nGovernance Requirements\n: All new use cases require approval through Google governance managed through Enterprise\nBusiness Architecture. Submit AIR request to initiate process.\nBusiness Responsibility\n: Business area teams are responsible for:\nLocal contracting\nDirect billing\nDriving appropriate design approvals (EBA, Cyber, Legal, Privacy, Quality)\nOngoing support model\nManaging potentially slower processes due to custom solution requirements\nGovernance Framework\n​\nA centralized governance model will oversee all technology initiatives involving Google services.\nGovernance Structure\n​\nOwnership\n: Enterprise Business Architecture (EBA) team will own the governance model\nProject Transparency\n: All initiatives will be submitted to the AI registry\nInvestment Decisions\n: Information Officers (IOs) will own decisions to invest in local business solutions\nArchitectural Compliance\n: Local area lead architects are responsible for ensuring solutions adhere to positioning\nguidelines\nAI Capability Decision Authority\n: Enterprise AI Architect and AI Architecture and Operations (AIAO) will own\ndecisions for:\nAddition of new AI services\nA2A framework implementation\nAI Model Decision Authority\n: Advanced Intelligence will own decisions for:\nEvaluation and approval of models not currently available through Cortex\nUse case-specific model approval and technical recommendations\nCloud Capabilities Decision Authority\n: Enterprise Cloud Architect and Cloud Architecture and Strategy Team (CAST)\nwill own decisions for:\nAddition of any new foundational cloud services\nWas this helpful?\nEdit this page\nPrevious\nAgentic Enterprise\nNext\nPlatforms\nExecutive Summary\nStrategic Positioning\nAI Platform\nDual-Cloud Foundation\nKey Google Proprietary Services\nVertex AI\nGemini Models\nAgentSpace\nA2A Protocol Positioning\nAgent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Overview\nGoogle Technology Adoption Framework\nAdvanced Cloud and AI Offerings\nGoogle Agents and A2A Protocol\nContainerized Business Services\nGovernance Framework\nGovernance Structure\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
