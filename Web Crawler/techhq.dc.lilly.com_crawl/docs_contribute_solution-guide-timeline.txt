Solution Guide Delivery Lifecycle
Working Group
​
The 'Directly Responsible' solution guide owner assembles the team to kickstart the creation of the solution guide. This
stage involves gathering the necessary experts and stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive and well-rounded guide. We
recommend scheduling a standing meeting cadence for the drafting process.
First Draft
​
The team outlines the use cases and technologies relevant to the solution guide. This stage involves initial research
and documentation to create a foundational draft. The first draft should be checked in and published to the TechHQ
non-prod environment.
Public Draft Refinement
​
Subject matter experts (SMEs) provide input and iterate on the draft. This stage focuses on refining the content to
ensure accuracy and relevance. The Public Draft should be promoted to TechHQ Prod by removing the
draft:
true
or
unlisted: true
metadata.
Request For Comment
​
Crucial feedback is gathered from stakeholders and other relevant parties. This stage involves collecting and
incorporating feedback to enhance the guide's comprehensiveness and usability.
Living Document
​
Once all feedback has been incorporated and the guide is finalized, it becomes a Living Document. This status indicates
that the guide will be continuously updated and revised as needed to remain current and relevant.
