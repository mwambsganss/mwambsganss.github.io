See guidance\nhere\nAWS Glue\n​\nAWS Glue is a serverless data integration service ideal for ETL workloads. It supports real-time and batch processing, integrates natively with AWS services, and can be orchestrated via Airflow or Lambda. It’s well-suited for preparing data for analytics and machine learning.  Glue, Glue Studio and Glue Catalogs are used extensively in Enterprise Data.\nAzure Data Factory\n​\nADF is Azure’s ETL and data movement tool. It supports hybrid data integration and can connect to AWS S3, on-prem databases, and third-party services. It is used for orchestrating data flows across environments with built-in monitoring and retry capabilities.\nMulesoft\n​\nMulesoft provides a robust integration platform for connecting cloud and on-prem systems. It supports API-led connectivity, reusable connectors, and policy enforcement. It’s particularly valuable for legacy system integration and enterprise service bus (ESB) patterns. At Lilly, Mulesoft is classified as specialized and used only in Digital Health and Manufacturing.  Open Source stacks like Backstage and FastAPI are cheaper options and avoid vendor lock-in.\nApache Airflow\n​\nAirflow is a workflow orchestration tool used to schedule and monitor complex data pipelines. It integrates with AWS Glue, Azure ADF, and other analytics platforms. It’s useful for managing dependencies and ensuring reliable execution of analytics workflows.  Airflow is used extensively in Enterprise Data.\nInformatica\n​\nInformatica offers enterprise-grade data integration, governance, and quality tools. It supports hybrid cloud deployments and is often used for regulated environments requiring lineage and auditability. It integrates with AWS, Azure, and Splunk for end-to-end data management.  At Lilly, Informatica is classified as specialized and is used for on-prem Manufacturing worksloads, particularly with systems residing behind S95 Level-3 network frewalls.\nSplunk\n​\nSplunk is a real-time analytics and observability platform. It ingests logs, metrics, and events from cloud and on-prem systems. It’s used for security monitoring, alerting, and dashboarding. Integration with API Gateway and Glue enables real-time notifications and insights.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\ndata\nsolution-guide\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n🧭 Data Visualization\nNext\n🧭 Specialized Databases\nAWS Glue\nAzure Data Factory\nMulesoft\nApache Airflow\nInformatica\nSplunk\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
