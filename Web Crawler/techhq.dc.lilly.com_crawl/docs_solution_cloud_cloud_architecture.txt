Cloud Architecture & Engineering Deeper Dives...
For deeper technical documentation, platform-specific guidance, and access to tooling resources, Lilly’s centralized
Cloud Library
at
https://cloud.lilly.com
is the authoritative source. It includes detailed information on AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms, FinOps practices, developer tooling, AI offerings, and enterprise cloud strategy. Use it as your starting point for cloud enablement across the organization.
Terminology in Lilly Cloud Architecture
​
DX
– Data center connected environments without Internet-facing endpoints
NoDX
– Internet-facing environments without data center connectivity
Private Cloud
– Lilly data center workloads
for a more complete explaination of DX vs NoDX Terminology reference the following Lilly Flow Article:

Important DX accounts
:
EDB
– Enterprise Data Backbone for development, QA, and production
SAP
- Hosts critical SAP ERP infrastructure.
InfoHub
– Hosts critical infrastructure like regmol-redqa-db and livedesignwk
Hanger (CATS)
– Modular content and API gateway deployments
Bioinformatics DX
– Genomics workflows with S3, Batch, Parallel Cluster, and ECR
Important NoDX accounts
:
GS
– LillyNow
GS
- iTravel
Digital Core
- TPET
MQ
- One QMS
Important Constraints
​
Service Control & Boundary Policies
DX accounts governed by stricter boundary policies
NoDX accounts require additional governance for public internet exposure

Deployment Patterns
​
Hanger/CATS
– Orchestrates DX deployments
Cloud Central Vending Machine
– Provisions S3 buckets, databases
Infrastructure as Code
– GitHub Actions + CloudFormation
Azure
​
Landscape
​
Azure follows the
Cloud Adaption Framework
(CAF) of Microsoft and applies the Enterprise Scale
Landing Zone
architecture.

Important NoDX subscriptions
:
(To be defined)
ChatNow
Important Constraints
​
DX subscriptions bypass Bastion host requirements
NoDX subscriptions require Bastion hosts and DNS policy exemptions
Both Environments are governed through
Enterprise Policy as Code
(EPAC)
Access to Subscriptions is granted through membership of explicit Access Packages via
Microsoft My Access
All deployments need to happen through a pipeline executing Infrastructure as Code, leverage linting and coding best practices.
! MESSAGING - "To be discussed" since Email services are supposed to be used either by AWS Service or M365 Graph access
Deployment Patterns
​
Cloud Central Vending
Provision individual subscriptions (SBX / DEV / QA / PROD)
Azure One-Click with DEV/QA/PROD Subscriptions tied to a single GitHub Repo with OIDC connected Service Principal for CI/CD.
Provision Databases & Analytics Services
Provision NetApp Storage
Provision Compute - Windows & soon RHEL
Hangar -
Containerized Solutions in Azure RedHat OpenShift
Infrastructure as Code
GitHub Actions
Bicep -> Curated
Bicep Module Repository
based on
Azure-Verified-Modules (AVM)
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
​
Important Constraints
