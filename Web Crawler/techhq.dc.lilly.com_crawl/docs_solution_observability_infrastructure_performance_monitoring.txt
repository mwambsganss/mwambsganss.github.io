:::warning
Avoid deploying multiple overlapping monitoring tools without a clear integration strategy. Redundant tooling increases cost, complexity, and data fragmentation.

## Why This Matters: Shifting from Health Checks to Proactive Intelligence
Infrastructure Performance Monitoring (IPM) is no longer a passive check of CPU and RAM. For technical leaders and architects, IPM is the foundational data layer that feeds all AIOps, capacity planning, and automation initiatives. A poor IPM strategy creates blind spots, leads to reactive firefighting, and prevents successful deployment of advanced automation.
### The Goal
Move from simply knowing that a server is down (reactivity) to understanding why a specific component is degrading a critical business service and predicting the failure before it happens (proactivity).

Architects must ensure the IPM solution collects the right types of data, with sufficient context, to be considered "AI-Ready."
### 1. High-Cardinality Metrics (The "What")</ExternalLink>
:::info[High-Cardinality Metrics]
- Use unified agents (e.g., Splunk Observability Agents, Prometheus exporters)
- Store raw metrics in a TSDB (e.g., Splunk Metrics, Thanos)
- Retain data for 12–18 months for capacity planning and anomaly detection
:::
### 2. Centralized, Structured Logging (The "Why")
:::info[Structured Logging]
- Enforce JSON format at the source using Fluentd or Logstash
- Ensure logs are tagged with host metadata for correlation
- Link logs to topology maps in AIOps platforms (e.g., ITSI)
:::
### 3. Topology & Dependency Mapping (The "Where")
:::info[Dependency Mapping]
- Build service models using CMDB and NetBrain
- Use automated discovery tools to avoid manual mapping
- Feed topology into AIOps for impact analysis and prioritization
:::

:::tip[Agent Deployment Insight]
- Use Sidecar pattern for Kubernetes
- Use Golden Image for VMs
- Avoid manual agent installs

## Technology Details
### AppDynamics
Strategic platform for full-stack observability. Deep integration with ServiceNow and Oasis. Supports automated RCA and incident response.
### Prometheus + Grafana
Open-source stack for cloud-native environments. Ideal for Kubernetes and Docker. Supports high-cardinality metrics and custom dashboards.
### Dynatrace
AI-powered monitoring with automatic anomaly detection. Supports OpenTelemetry and dynamic environments. Emerging within enterprise AIOps.
### Nagios
Legacy tool for basic server and network monitoring. Limited cloud-native support. Consider migration to modern platforms.
### Datadog
Standard tool for multi-cloud observability. Unified dashboards and alerting. Supports OpenTelemetry and hybrid environments.
### SolarWinds NPM
Specialized for network performance. SNMP-based telemetry. Ideal for real-time traffic and latency monitoring.

### Recommendations to Improve Guide Usability
1. **Add Decision Trees** to help architects choose technologies based on environment type (cloud-native, legacy, hybrid).
2. **Embed Deployment Playbooks** for agent rollout, TSDB setup, and logging standardization.
3. **Include Governance Notes** to clarify approval and onboarding processes for each tool.
