A data catalog acts like a library index for all enterprise data assets—datasets, tables, files, and databases—across cloud, on-prem, and hybrid environments. It enables users to:
Quickly locate and understand data through metadata, lineage, and quality scores.
Avoid duplication and reduce time spent searching for data.
Support self-service analytics by empowering non-technical users to find and use data confidently.
Lilly creates two things: Medicine and Data. A LOT of data. Data catalogs help Lilly manage that data to help us ensure we know where the data is, who owns it, how sensitive it is, and describes that data. Quality descriptions of data help teams identify if the data is good for their use case, enables AI to use the data effectively, and define what the data can, or cannot, be used for.
Lilly is a global company and so has challenges due to the different types of data collected, the technologies it is stored in, and the many different global governance rules that dictate what the data can be used for. Enterprise Data is helping Lilly meet those challenges by building a robust catalog solution that serves as single source of truth for metadata describing our data, access to that data, and a doorway to view observability facets of that data. A single solution for Lilly to describe and manage Lilly data.
The solution is provided through two applications found at
