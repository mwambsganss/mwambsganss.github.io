AI Architecture Ecosystem
​
The AI Architecture Ecosystem defines the layers, capabilities, and platforms approved for use at Lilly. It consists of
six interconnected layers:
Experience Layer
: Consistent human interfaces for AI-enabled products
AI Layer
: Reusable capabilities merging deterministic and probabilistic approaches
Model Layer
: Commercial capabilities for ML/LLM with MLOps features
Data Layer
: AI-enabled data capabilities like vector databases and semantic layers
Infrastructure Layer
: Secure compute and storage foundations for regulated environments
Responsible AI Layer
: Guardrails for ethical, regulatory, and security standards
AI Design Patterns
​
AI Design Patterns provide proven approaches to designing and implementing AI solutions:
Agentic Patterns
: Architectural approaches for AI agents (Single Agent, ReAct, Plan-and-Execute, etc.)
Workflows
: Distinctions between agents and workflows, with patterns like Prompt Chaining and Routing
Context Engineering
: Strategies for optimizing context windows through Write, Select, Compress, and Isolate techniques
Protocols
: Communication standards for agent-to-agent (A2A) and agent-tool (MCP) interactions
Lilly Cloud MCP
: Implementation of Model Context Protocol servers for Lilly systems
AI Positioning
​
AI Positioning defines the strategic approach to AI technologies at Lilly:
Google Positioning
: Strategic approach to Google's AI technologies and services
Implementation Examples
​
Practical examples of AI implementations across different use cases:
Press Release Drafter (PRD)
: Agentic AI system for automating press release generation from clinical trial results
with multi-agent reasoning and MLR compliance
Press Release Miner (PRM)
: Multi-agent research system for extracting insights from documents and generating
briefing materials using ReAct and parallel processing patterns
