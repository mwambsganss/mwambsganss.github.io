warning
Avoid storing unencrypted sensitive data in S3 buckets or transmitting PI without TLS encryption. Always apply IAM policies and KMS encryption.
AWS Macie
​
Macie is a fully managed data security and privacy service that uses machine learning to discover and protect sensitive data in AWS. It automatically scans S3 buckets for PI keywords such as names, addresses, credit card numbers, and social security numbers. Macie integrates with CloudTrail for audit logging and IAM for access control.
Use Cases
: S3 bucket scanning, compliance audits, alerting on sensitive data exposure.
Key Features
: ML-based classification, customizable detection rules, automated remediation workflows. Allows to detect a large and growing list of sensitive data types for many countries and Regions, including multiple types of financial data, personal health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information (PII), as well as custom types.
AWS Glue Data Quality
​
Glue DQ
can measure and monitor the data quality of Amazon S3 based data lakes, data warehouses, and other data repositories. It automatically computes statistics, recommends quality rules, and can monitor and alert you when it detects PI key words, missing, stale, or bad data. You can access it in the AWS Glue Data Catalog and in AWS Glue Data Catalog ETL jobs.
Use Cases
: ETL pipelines with embedded PI detection, data masking before analytics.
Key Features
: Detect PII transform, regex-based masking, column-level sensitivity scanning.
AWS Kinesis + Lambda
​
For real-time data streams, AWS Kinesis can ingest data while Lambda functions inspect and classify sensitive content on the fly. This is ideal for use cases like chatbots, IoT telemetry, or transactional logs.
Use Cases
: Streaming PII detection, real-time alerts, dynamic masking.
Key Features
: Event-driven architecture, scalable processing, integration with Macie.
AWS Comprehend
​
AWS Comprehend is service that can be applied to various use cases, including PI data detection, customer feedback analysis, content categorization, and sentiment analysis. By leveraging this service, businesses can gain deeper insights into their data, identify and dedact PI data, improve decision-making, and enhance customer experience.
AWS Comprehend is typically integrated into ETL pipelines to
enrich data
before loading it into analytics platforms or data lakes.
Use Cases
: Natural language processing (NLP) based PI detection, real-time and batch data processing
Key Features
: country specific PI entity types, Redact PI entities, Locate PI entities
