Jira is the preferred test management tool over ALM. Test management tool to manage various application lifecycle stages from requirements gathering and testing to defect management.
Use Cases
​
Provide highly regulated teams (especially for GXP or GMP applications) a way to formally track requirements, test artifacts and defects.
Notes
​
Jira, along with testing capabilities provided through Xray, should be considered as an alternative when possible.
