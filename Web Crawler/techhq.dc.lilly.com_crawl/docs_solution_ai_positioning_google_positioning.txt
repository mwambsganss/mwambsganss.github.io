Executive Summary
​
This document outlines Eli Lilly's strategic positioning regarding Google technologies, services, and platforms. While
maintaining our dual-cloud strategy with Azure and AWS as primary platforms, we recognize Google's specialized
capabilities in advanced AI and other unique business solutions. This document provides guidance on when and how Google
technologies should be evaluated, adopted, and governed within our enterprise architecture.
Strategic Positioning
​
AI Platform
​
We are taking a cloud-agnostic approach to AI at Lilly, with Cortex as our main platform. For a complete view of our AI
platform positioning, refer our AI Positioning document. Approved platforms, such as Cortex, should be explored before
considering Google AI capabilities.
Model Approval Process
: All AI models must be approved for specific use cases by the Advanced Intelligence team. Models are not blanket approved but rather evaluated and approved based on their technical suitability for individual business requirements and use cases.
Please feel free to reach out to your local area architect, the Enterprise AI Architecture team or the Cortex Product team for consult on best path for your solution.
Requesting New Model Evaluation
: If there is a Google model that you would like to explore further that is not available in Cortex or LLM Gateway, please reach out to the Advanced Intelligence team to help you evaluate the model for your specific solution and use case.
Dual-Cloud Foundation
​
Lilly maintains a dual-cloud strategy with Azure and AWS as our primary platforms. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is
positioned as a specialized solution for specific use cases rather than a third general-purpose hyperscaler.
Primary Platforms
:
Azure
and
AWS
remain our primary focus for cloud and AI solutions
Evaluation Process
:
Azure
and
AWS
solutions must be evaluated first before considering Google capabilities
Google's Role
: Specialized provider for
unique
business capabilities.
Key Google Proprietary Services
​
Lilly has identified several proprietary Google services that offer unique capabilities aligned with our strategic
needs. These services are evaluated and adopted based on their ability to deliver specialized functionality that
complements our existing technology stack.
info
For each of these solutions, the business area team/leader will be responsible for local contracting,
direct billing, driving appropriate design approvals (e.g. EBA, Cyber, Legal, Privacy, Quality), and ongoing support
model. Teams should expect slower process for these initiatives given the custom nature of the solution and lack of
enterprise approved patterns.
Vertex AI
​
Vertex AI is Google Cloud's unified machine learning platform that enables the training and deployment of ML models and
AI applications at scale.
Key Features
: AutoML capabilities, custom model training, MLOps tooling, and model monitoring
Strategic Value
: Provides advanced ML capabilities with simplified workflows for data scientists and ML engineers
Use Cases
: Predictive analytics, computer vision applications, and specialized ML model deployment
Lilly Strategy Today
: Not approved for separate implementation. Only can be used as part of an Agentspace
containerized solution with governance approval. (See Agentspace below)
Gemini Models
​
Gemini represents Google's most advanced multimodal AI models, capable of understanding and generating content across
text, code, audio, image, and video.
Key Features
: Multimodal capabilities, advanced reasoning, and state-of-the-art performance
Strategic Value
: Enables sophisticated AI applications that can process and generate multiple types of content
Use Cases
: Complex content generation, multimodal analysis, and advanced reasoning tasks
Lilly Strategy Today
: Gemini models are available through Cortex with use case limitations. Please contact the
Cortex team to discuss use case specifics. Alternatively, you could leverage the LLM Recommender for available models
with strengths comparable with Gemini models:

AgentSpace
​
AgentSpace is Google's platform for building, deploying, and managing AI agents that can perform complex tasks through
reasoning and tool use.
Key Features
: Agent development framework, built-in reasoning capabilities, and tool integration
Strategic Value
: Enables the creation of specialized AI agents tailored to specific business processes
Use Cases
: Automated workflows, intelligent assistants, and process automation
Lilly Strategy Today
: AgentSpace is not established as a foundational enterprise service at this time as feature
sets are similar (and in some cases less mature) than corresponding features in Azure and AWS. For approved business
use cases, a containerized deployment of AgentSpace with custom UI is appropriate to enable usage of the broader
Google AI platform capabilities.
A2A Protocol Positioning
​
Lilly Strategy Today
: Lilly is committed to advancing industry standard agent communication protocols and to the
potential for A2A to be a leading standard for our adoption. Since we are still early days with this standard, we should
be cautious in assuming it will address full interoperability in the longer term. Our approach at this time is to
establish defined standards within Lilly that leverage A2A as input but also keep us independent.
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Overview
​
A2A is an open protocol developed by Google that enables AI agents built on different platforms to communicate and
collaborate effectively.
Key Features
: Standardized communication format, capability discovery, and task management
Strategic Value
: Facilitates interoperability between agents in a heterogeneous AI ecosystem
Use Cases
: Complex workflows requiring multiple specialized agents, cross-platform agent collaboration
Additional Information
: Please see our
protocols documentation
for more detailed
information and connect with the AI Architecture team with any urgent considerations for your projects.
Google Technology Adoption Framework
​
Advanced Cloud and AI Offerings
​
We have established a Google Cloud Platform Landing Zone to ensure we have capabilities available to support priority
use cases. This is not setup for general use and we are not planning on qualifying any additional Google services until
we have determined the value/cost benefits to broadening our Cloud and AI footprint.
Google Agents and A2A Protocol
​
Lilly will strategically leverage Google Agents within our environment where they align with business requirements.
Agent Integration
: A2A registered agents will be integrated as qualified agents where applicable
Protocol Standards
: Lilly is committed to advancing industry standard agent communication protocols
A2A Approach
: While recognizing A2A's potential as a leading standard, we maintain a cautious approach
Internal Standards
: We will establish defined standards within Lilly that leverage A2A as input while maintaining
independence
Containerized Business Services
​
The architecture pattern established with tech transfer will serve as our model for other prioritized business value
initiatives.
Architecture Pattern
: AgentSpace backend with custom UI, building agents using ADK for Agent Engine
Implementation Approach
: Creation of bespoke agents tailored to specific business needs
Governance Requirements
: All new use cases require approval through Google governance managed through Enterprise
Business Architecture. Submit AIR request to initiate process.
Business Responsibility
: Business area teams are responsible for:
Local contracting
Direct billing
Driving appropriate design approvals (EBA, Cyber, Legal, Privacy, Quality)
Ongoing support model
Managing potentially slower processes due to custom solution requirements
Governance Framework
​
A centralized governance model will oversee all technology initiatives involving Google services.
Governance Structure
​
Ownership
: Enterprise Business Architecture (EBA) team will own the governance model
Project Transparency
: All initiatives will be submitted to the AI registry
Investment Decisions
: Information Officers (IOs) will own decisions to invest in local business solutions
Architectural Compliance
: Local area lead architects are responsible for ensuring solutions adhere to positioning
guidelines
AI Capability Decision Authority
: Enterprise AI Architect and AI Architecture and Operations (AIAO) will own
decisions for:
Addition of new AI services
A2A framework implementation
AI Model Decision Authority
: Advanced Intelligence will own decisions for:
Evaluation and approval of models not currently available through Cortex
Use case-specific model approval and technical recommendations
Cloud Capabilities Decision Authority
: Enterprise Cloud Architect and Cloud Architecture and Strategy Team (CAST)
will own decisions for:
Addition of any new foundational cloud services
