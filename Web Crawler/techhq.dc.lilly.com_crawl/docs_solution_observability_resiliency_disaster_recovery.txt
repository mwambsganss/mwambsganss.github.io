This guide outlines our approach to system resiliency, the ability to withstand disruptions, recover from failures, and
maintain continuous operations. This encompasses disaster recovery (DR) capabilities, high availability (HA)
architecture, and business continuity planning. Proper resiliency ensures that critical business functions continue
operating during hardware failures, software issues, network outages, or even catastrophic events. This document
provides guidance on determining your application's resiliency requirements based on business criticality and
implementing appropriate architectural patterns to achieve the required level of service availability.
Resiliency Design Steps
​
Assess Application Criticality
: Begin by identifying the Business Application CI ID in ServiceNow. Detailed
instructions can be found in the
Determine Application Criticality document
.
This step is crucial for understanding the criticality of your application within its business context.
Define Resiliency Requirements
: Next, use the
[Resiliency Tier / Infrastructure Matrix](#resiliency-tier--infrastructure-matrix) below to determine the system's
resiliency requirements. This will help you identify the necessary measures to ensure your application's availability
and reliability. You can also refer to the
Resiliency Requirements document
for additional detail for your application's tier.
Implement Resilient Architecture
: Based on your application's tier, follow the guidelines in the
Resiliency Patterns document
.
This resource provides comprehensive information on building high resiliency for various infrastructure components
like VMs, databases, and containers. It also explains different disaster recovery (DR) models, helping you design a
robust and fault-tolerant system.
Critical Systems Governance
​
Tier 0, Critical Systems and Local HA Manufacturing must follow the governance processes for Critical Systems,
documented here
.

If you have a system where you only want a subset of critical recovered after a disaster, rather than the entire app
refer to [this section](#critical-data) .
Tier 0-A
​
This tier includes critical applications like authentication and networking. An Active-Active DR model is ideal.
DR RTO
: < 1 hour
DR RPO
: < 15 minutes
High Availability RTO
: < 1 hour
High Availability RPO
: < 15 minutes
Backups
: One copy locally, one in a secondary region
Monitoring
: Implement monitoring and alerting
DR Testing
: Annual tests to ensure recovery within RTO and RPO
HA Testing
: Test before production. For Active-Active, DR tests also serve as HA tests
DR Assessments
: Periodic assessments for compliance
Tier 0-B
​
This tier includes applications essential for recovering other applications after a disaster, such as backup systems.
These have high resiliency requirements, though less stringent than Tier 0-A. If Active-Active is not feasible for DR,
consider Warm-Active or Pilot Light models.
DR RTO
: < 4 hours
DR RPO
: < 15 minutes
High Availability RTO
: < 2 hours
High Availability RPO
: < 15 minutes
Backups
: One copy locally, one in a secondary region
Monitoring
: Implement monitoring and alerting
DR Testing
: Annual tests to ensure recovery within RTO and RPO
HA Testing
: Test before production. For Active-Active, DR tests also serve as HA tests
DR Assessments
: Periodic assessments for compliance
Critical High Cloud
​
This tier includes applications hosted in native Azure or AWS (not AVS) that, if unavailable for more than 8 hours,
would negatively impact the enterprise. Pilot Light models are sufficient for these applications.
DR RTO
: < 8 hours
DR RPO
: < 1 hour
High Availability RTO
: < 4.5 hours
High Availability RPO
: < 15 minutes
Backups
: One copy locally, one in a secondary region
Monitoring
: Implement monitoring and alerting
DR Testing
: Annual tests to ensure recovery within RTO and RPO
HA Testing
: Test before production. For Active-Active, DR tests also serve as HA tests
DR Assessments
: Periodic assessments for compliance
Critical High On-Prem
​
This tier includes applications hosted on-prem or in AVS that, if unavailable for more than 8 hours, would negatively
impact the enterprise. Pilot Light models are sufficient. The DR team offers a managed solution for this. To onboard
systems, check out this

.
Note that there is a
charge
for this.
DR RTO
: < 8 hours
DR RPO
: < 1 hour
Backups
: One copy locally, one in a secondary region
Monitoring
: Implement monitoring and alerting

DR Assessments
: Periodic assessments for compliance
Critical Medium Cloud
​
This tier includes applications hosted in native Azure or AWS (not AVS) that, if unavailable for more than 24 hours,
would negatively impact the enterprise. Pilot Light models are sufficient for these applications.
DR RTO
: < 24 hours
DR RPO
: < 1 hour
High Availability RTO
: < 8 hours
High Availability RPO
: < 15 minutes
Backups
: One copy locally, one in a secondary region

: Periodic assessments for compliance
Critical Medium On-Prem
​
This tier includes applications hosted on-prem or in AVS that, if unavailable for more than 24 hours, would negatively
impact the enterprise. Pilot Light models are sufficient. The DR team offers a managed solution for this. To onboard
systems, check out this

Critical Low Cloud
​
This tier includes applications hosted in native Azure or AWS (not AVS) that, if unavailable for more than 72 hours,
would negatively impact the enterprise. Pilot Light models are sufficient for these applications.
DR RTO
: < 72 hours
DR RPO
: < 1 hour
High Availability RTO
: < 24 hours
High Availability RPO
: < 15 minutes
Backups

: One copy locally, one in a secondary region
Monitoring
: Implement monitoring and alerting
DR Testing
: Annual tests to ensure recovery within RTO and RPO
DR Assessments
: Periodic assessments for compliance
Local HA Manufacturing
​
This tier includes applications hosted on-prem at a manufacturing site, excluding global manufacturing applications. If
a manufacturing site goes down, only the data at that site is recovered, not a full IT system recovery. Manufacturing
cannot afford downtime due to component failure, so high availability is essential, typically achieved with dual
computer rooms.
High Availability RTO
: < 2 hours
High Availability RPO
: < 0 minutes
Backups
: One copy locally, one in a secondary region
Monitoring
: Implement monitoring and alerting
DR Assessments
: Periodic assessments for compliance
Critical Data
​
If you have a system that does not need to be brought up immediately after a disaster but contains data needed
immediately, refer to the section titled ‘
Saving data separately from applications
’ in
Resiliency Patterns
If you have a question, you can discuss it with your
DR Steward
or send an email to
resiliency@lists.lilly.com
.
All Other Systems
​
All production systems not covered by the above categories fall into this one. In case of a disaster, these systems will
be recovered via backup. This is a best effort process and may take 3-4 months.
DR RPO
: < 24 hours
Backups
: One copy locally, one in a secondary region
