Bringing Model Development to Production
​
Hypervisor for AI teams to leverage advanced compute for model training, serving, and advanced AI workloads
Accelerate time-to-value for ML investments by reducing infrastructure and engineering load on ML teams
Enhanced visibility, collaboration, and reproducibility across model development lifecycle
Increase advanced compute utilization rates through optimized resource management

Platform
Current State Initiative
​
The current implementation uses Magtrain with Slurm:
Centralized job scheduling: Resource allocation, job scheduling, and distribution of workloads
Queue-based management: Structured queue system that tracks pending, running, and completed tasks
Command Line Interface (CLI): Interaction through standardized CLI commands (i.e., sbatch, squeue, scancel) for job submission and monitoring
Storage access: Direct integration with shared storage systems
Current State SLURM Architecture

Current Migration Underway
​
Migration from Slurm to Run.ai, which provides more robust GPU orchestration and resource management capabilities.
Next Steps
​
Evaluate MLflow or Weights & Biases for model training and serving capabilities, leveraging learnings from LRL's model gateway implementation.
Platform Resources:
MLflow:
https://mlflow.org/
Weights & Biases:
https://wandb.ai/site
Evaluation Focus Areas:
The assessment will cover ML lifecycle management, experiment tracking, model deployment, and visualization capabilities. Key considerations include:
Comparative analysis of platform capabilities and limitations
Compatibility and integration potential between the two platforms
Feature mapping for core ML operations (tracking, registry, deployment)
Data scientist user experience and workflow optimization
Alignment with existing infrastructure and team requirements
MLflow vs Weights & Biases: Feature Comparison
​
Feature Category
MLflow
Weights & Biases
Overview
Open-source, vendor-neutral platform from Databricks. Emphasizes flexibility and on-premise deployment
Commercial cloud-based platform. Emphasizes ease-of-use, collaboration, and rich hosted interface
Experiment Tracking
Simple API with basic UI. Supports autologging for major frameworks. Requires server setup for teams
Polished web UI with real-time sync. Plug-and-play setup with rich media support and live updates
Model Registry & Artifacts
Built-in registry with lifecycle management (staging, production). Works with any storage backend
Integrated registry with versioned artifacts. Tightly coupled with tracking and includes collaborative dashboards
Hyperparameter Tuning
No built-in HPO. Integrates with external tools (Optuna, Ray Tune, HyperOpt)
First-class Sweeps feature with grid, random, and Bayesian optimization. Automated visualization of results
Visualization & Reporting
Basic web UI with simple charts and run comparisons. Limited visualization capabilities
Rich interactive platform with custom charts, embedding projector, and shareable Reports for storytelling
Deployment & Serving
Built-in model serving as REST APIs. Supports local, cloud, and edge deployments
No native serving capabilities. Focuses on handoff to external deployment infrastructure
Pipeline Orchestration
Not an orchestration framework. Requires external tools (Airflow, Kubeflow) for pipelines
Not a pipeline engine. Uses external tools for workflow orchestration beyond HPO sweeps
Ecosystem & Integrations
Extensive framework support (TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc.). Language-agnostic with REST API
Broad SDK support with official integrations. Includes MLflow importer for migration compatibility
Collaboration & Team Features
Basic collaboration via shared server. No built-in user management or access controls
Team-centric design with RBAC, SSO, audit logs, and real-time collaboration features
Pricing & Licensing
Completely free and open-source. No licensing costs
Tiered SaaS model: Free tier available, Pro (~$50/mo), Enterprise (custom pricing)
Data Scientist Workflow
DIY approach requiring manual setup. Straightforward but needs infrastructure management
Plug-and-play experience with instant web interface. More visual and collaborative workflow
Key Takeaways
​
MLflow
excels for organizations wanting vendor-neutral, self-hosted solutions with full control over infrastructure
Weights & Biases
excels for teams prioritizing collaboration, rich visualization, and managed cloud experience
Both platforms are
compatible
- W&B can import MLflow experiments, and MLflow can sync with W&B sweeps
Choice depends on priorities:
openness vs convenience
,
required features
, and
budget constraints
