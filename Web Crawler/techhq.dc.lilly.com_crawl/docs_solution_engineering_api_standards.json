It enhances discoverability and governance by providing a catalog of reusable Lilly APIs and services.\nCheck out Backstage documentation at the links below:\n📚\nEntity Catalog\n: Search for reusable APIs, Components, and Resources enterprise-wide before trying to rebuild one from scratch.\n🚀\nAccelerators\n: Jumpstart development for a new API, Website, and more using templated code with Lilly best practices built-in.\n📚\nTechDocs\n: Write some markdown and let Backstage host your docs website and integrate it with search on your behalf using the mkdocs framework.\n🔍\nSearch\n: All reusable assets added to Lilly Backstage and the matching items from LillyFlow can be found using the Search feature in the sidebar.\n📂\nClient Code Generation\n: Found an API to reuse? Let Backstage generate client side code efficiently with built-in best practices to consume faster.\n📊\nPlatform Insights\n: See our estimations for how much time Backstage has saved Lilly developers so far!\n‼️ Does your team own some re-usable software? You can add it to the Entity Catalog with our\nCatalog Integration Tutorial\nin just 3 easy steps!\nAzure API Management\n​\nEnterprise Data provides Azure API Management (APIM) as a global API Gateway service.  Delegate authentication, authorization, and threat protection to APIM so you can focus on your API's functionality and business value.\nCheck out APIM documentation at the links below:\n📚\nPlatform Overview\n: Learn more about the platform and how it fits in solution architectures.\n🚀\nGetting Started\n: Get your APIs published in / secured by Azure APIM.\nFastAPI Framework for Building REST APIs\n​\nFastAPI is a modern Python framework for building high-performance APIs with automatic OpenAPI documentation. It is ideal for lightweight services and microservices.\nFeatures:\nAutomatic OpenAPI and JSON Schema generation\nfor documentation and validation\nAsynchronous support\nusing Python’s async/await for high-performance APIs\nType hinting and data validation\nwith Pydantic for cleaner, safer code\nFast development cycles\nwith minimal boilerplate and intuitive syntax\nBackstage Accelerators\nhas a FastAPI Template to help you get started with this framework.\nStrawberry Framework for Building GraphQL APIs\n​\nStrawberry is a Python library for building GraphQL APIs using modern Python features like type hints and dataclasses. It simplifies GraphQL schema creation and integrates well with Python-based services. Strawberry is ideal for teams looking to expose flexible, queryable APIs and works seamlessly with Hangar CI/CD and Azure API Management for deployment and monitoring.\nFeatures:\nNative support\nfor Python type hints and dataclasses\nAutomatic GraphQL schema generation\nfor documentation and validation\nEasy integration\nwith ASGI frameworks like FastAPI\nBackstage Accelerators\nhas a GraphQL Template to help you get started with this framework.\nDeploying APIs at Lilly\n​\nOur team highly recommmends using the Kubernetes clusters by the\nCATS\nand\nKubed\nteams at Lilly for containerized deployments. These platforms provide enterprise support and have several features making your deployment experience easier and more reliable.\nFor more information on containerized deployments, see\nContainer Services\n.\nCOMING SOON: CATS and Lilly Kubed are merging into one platform called\nHangar\n.\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\napi\nsoftware-engineering\nsolution-guide\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n🧭 AI Code Assistants\nNext\n🧭 ML Ops\nBackstage\nAzure API Management\nFastAPI Framework for Building REST APIs\nStrawberry Framework for Building GraphQL APIs\nDeploying APIs at Lilly\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
