Always apply IAM policies and KMS encryption.\nAWS Macie\n​\nMacie is a fully managed data security and privacy service that uses machine learning to discover and protect sensitive data in AWS. It automatically scans S3 buckets for PI keywords such as names, addresses, credit card numbers, and social security numbers. Macie integrates with CloudTrail for audit logging and IAM for access control.\nUse Cases\n: S3 bucket scanning, compliance audits, alerting on sensitive data exposure.\nKey Features\n: ML-based classification, customizable detection rules, automated remediation workflows. Allows to detect a large and growing list of sensitive data types for many countries and Regions, including multiple types of financial data, personal health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information (PII), as well as custom types.\nAWS Glue Data Quality\n​\nGlue DQ\ncan measure and monitor the data quality of Amazon S3 based data lakes, data warehouses, and other data repositories. It automatically computes statistics, recommends quality rules, and can monitor and alert you when it detects PI key words, missing, stale, or bad data. You can access it in the AWS Glue Data Catalog and in AWS Glue Data Catalog ETL jobs.\nUse Cases\n: ETL pipelines with embedded PI detection, data masking before analytics.\nKey Features\n: Detect PII transform, regex-based masking, column-level sensitivity scanning.\nAWS Kinesis + Lambda\n​\nFor real-time data streams, AWS Kinesis can ingest data while Lambda functions inspect and classify sensitive content on the fly. This is ideal for use cases like chatbots, IoT telemetry, or transactional logs.\nUse Cases\n: Streaming PII detection, real-time alerts, dynamic masking.\nKey Features\n: Event-driven architecture, scalable processing, integration with Macie.\nAWS Comprehend\n​\nAWS Comprehend is service that can be applied to various use cases, including PI data detection, customer feedback analysis, content categorization, and sentiment analysis. By leveraging this service, businesses can gain deeper insights into their data, identify and dedact PI data, improve decision-making, and enhance customer experience.\nAWS Comprehend is typically integrated into ETL pipelines to\nenrich data\nbefore loading it into analytics platforms or data lakes.\nUse Cases\n: Natural language processing (NLP) based PI detection, real-time and batch data processing\nKey Features\n: country specific PI entity types, Redact PI entities, Locate PI entities\nList of 18 PHI identifiers\n​\nNames\nGeographic data\nAll elements of dates directly related to an Individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death, all ages overs 89 and dates indicative of such age and ages aggregated into single category of age 90 or older.\nTelephone numbers\nFax Numbers\nElectronic Mail addresses\nsocial security numbers\nmedical record numbers\nHealth plan beneficiary numbers\nAccount numbers\ncertificate/license numbers\nvehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers\ndevice identifiers and serial numbers\nweb universal resource locators (Web URLs)\nInternet Protocol (IP) address numbers\nBiometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints\nFull face photographic images and any comparable images\nany other unique identifying number, characteristic,\nGuidance on Methods for de-identification of PHI ->\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/de-identification/index.html\nCost comparison Enterprise Data Guidance page\n​\nhttps://lilly-confluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EDB/pages/1744175392/AWS+PII+Detection+Capabilities\nWas this helpful?\nTags:\nsolution-guide\nbusiness-enablement\ntechhq\nEdit this page\nPrevious\n🧭 Customer Engagement Reference Architecture\nNext\n☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure\nAWS Macie\nAWS Glue Data Quality\nAWS Kinesis + Lambda\nAWS Comprehend\nList of 18 PHI identifiers\nCost comparison Enterprise Data Guidance page\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
