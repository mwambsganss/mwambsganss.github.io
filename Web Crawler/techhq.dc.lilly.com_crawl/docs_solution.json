Our Reference Architecture exists to bring clarity, consistency, and\nalignment across that spectrum.\nIt’s more than a technical blueprint—it’s a thinking model that helps teams:\nUnderstand where they are in the solutioning journey\nAlign on the right architectural patterns\nNavigate toward the appropriate solution categories\nThis architecture is modular, scalable, and built to evolve—just like the problems we’re solving.\nUse Cases In Action\n​\nProblem Exploration\n​\n\"I'm not sure what my problem is.\"\n\"I know my problem and need to express it.\"\nThese are early-stage innovation needs. The architecture supports teams with tools for problem framing and collaborative\ndesign. These often lead into categories like\nAI & Intelligent Agents\nor\nBusiness Enablement\n, where intelligent\nsearch, automation, or knowledge systems help shape the solution.\nSaaS Integration\n​\n\"I've purchased a SaaS solution I want to implement.\"\nThis is a clear implementation scenario. The architecture provides identity, data integration, and orchestration\nplatforms to ensure secure and scalable onboarding. These needs typically align with\nCloud & Infrastructure\n,\nCybersecurity\n, and\nEngineering Enablement\n.\nAnalytics & Compute\n​\n\"I need high-performance analytics without specialized infrastructure.\"\n\"I need high-performance analytics with custom infrastructure.\"\nThe architecture supports both managed and custom compute paths:\nFor managed needs, analytics-as-a-service platforms offer speed and scale.\nFor custom needs, utility architecture enables tailored infrastructure design.\nThese use cases align with\nData & Analytics\nand\nCloud & Infrastructure\n.\nCustom AI & Web Tools\n​\n\"I want to implement a specialized AI solution in a custom web tool.\"\nThis blends innovation with delivery. The architecture supports this through a Dev Factory model with AI and web\ndevelopment specialties, and close collaboration with UX and business design. These efforts span\nAI & Intelligent\nAgents\n,\nUser Experience & Design\n, and\nEngineering Enablement\n.\nInternal Custom Development\n​\n\"I want to build a custom solution with my dev team.\"\nThis is a full-stack build scenario. The architecture provides DevX services, platforms, and API enablement to empower\ninternal teams. These efforts typically draw from\nEngineering Enablement\n,\nCloud & Infrastructure\n, and\nObservability & Reliability\n.\nThird-Party Integration\n​\n\"A partner needs to use our identity, AE checking, and consent models.\"\nThis is a governance-heavy integration. The architecture supports it through secure APIs, workflow orchestration, and\nbusiness services. These needs intersect with\nCybersecurity\n,\nCloud & Infrastructure\n, and\nBusiness\nEnablement\n—ensuring compliance, control, and auditability.\nTech Positioning\n​\nTech positioning is the strategic process of aligning technology (including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, tools, accelerators,\ncomponents, and features) with Lilly’s goals and business needs. This ensures that every technology investment supports\nbroader objectives, such as enhancing customer experience, improving operational efficiency, and driving innovation.\nTechnology Classifications\nWe use the following\ntechnology classifications\nto describe the maturity, adoption, and strategic relevance of\ntechnologies in Tech@Lilly:\nEmerging\n– Technologies or capabilities in the early stages of exploration and experimentation. These are\ntypically undergoing\nproof-of-value\n,\npilot programs\n, or\nviability testing\nto assess potential business impact\nand feasibility.\nSpecialized\n– Solutions that are\ntailored to specific use cases\n, departments, or business units. They are\nnot\nbroadly adopted\nacross the enterprise but deliver high value in their niche applications.\nStandard\n– Technologies or capabilities that are\napproved for enterprise-wide use\n. They are\nwell-supported,\nstable, and scalable\n, with established governance, documentation, and integration patterns.\nStrategic\n– Foundational technologies or platforms that are\ncritical to the enterprise’s long-term strategy\nand operations\n. These receive\nongoing investment\n, are\ndeeply embedded\nin business processes, and are\ncentral to\ninnovation, scalability, and resilience\n.\nDeclining\n– Technologies or capabilities that are\nno longer aligned with strategic direction\n. Investment is\nbeing reduced, and a\nretirement or replacement plan\nis being developed or considered.\nRetiring\n– Solutions that are in the\nactive process of being phased out\n. Replacement technologies have been\nidentified, and\nmigration or decommissioning efforts\nare underway.\nExited\n– Technologies or capabilities that have been\nfully retired\n. They are\nno longer supported, approved, or\nin use\nwithin the enterprise environment.\nProhibited\n– Technologies or practices that are\nexplicitly blocked or restricted\ndue to\nsubstantial risk\n,\ncompliance issues\n, or a\nformal enterprise architecture decision\n. Use is not permitted under any circumstances.\nTech positioning plays a key role in optimizing our technology landscape, mitigate risks, and minimizing the cost of\nchange. It is designed for architects and technical leaders responsible for delivering products and solutions and for\naligning technology with strategic business goals.\nYou can search and browse tech positioning records on\nLillyFlow\nusing the\ntech-positioning\ntag, which are maintained by EBA as articles.
