Our Reference Architecture
​
In today’s complex solutioning landscape, teams face a wide spectrum of needs—from ambiguous problem statements to
highly specialized technical implementations. Our Reference Architecture exists to bring clarity, consistency, and
alignment across that spectrum.
It’s more than a technical blueprint—it’s a thinking model that helps teams:
Understand where they are in the solutioning journey
Align on the right architectural patterns
Navigate toward the appropriate solution categories
This architecture is modular, scalable, and built to evolve—just like the problems we’re solving.
Use Cases In Action
​
Problem Exploration
​
"I'm not sure what my problem is."
"I know my problem and need to express it."
These are early-stage innovation needs. The architecture supports teams with tools for problem framing and collaborative
design. These often lead into categories like
AI & Intelligent Agents
or
Business Enablement
, where intelligent
search, automation, or knowledge systems help shape the solution.
SaaS Integration
​
"I've purchased a SaaS solution I want to implement."
This is a clear implementation scenario. The architecture provides identity, data integration, and orchestration
platforms to ensure secure and scalable onboarding. These needs typically align with
Cloud & Infrastructure
,
Cybersecurity
, and
Engineering Enablement
.
Analytics & Compute
​
"I need high-performance analytics without specialized infrastructure."
"I need high-performance analytics with custom infrastructure."
The architecture supports both managed and custom compute paths:
For managed needs, analytics-as-a-service platforms offer speed and scale.
For custom needs, utility architecture enables tailored infrastructure design.
These use cases align with
Data & Analytics
and
Cloud & Infrastructure
.
Custom AI & Web Tools
​
"I want to implement a specialized AI solution in a custom web tool."
This blends innovation with delivery. The architecture supports this through a Dev Factory model with AI and web
development specialties, and close collaboration with UX and business design. These efforts span
AI & Intelligent
Agents
,
User Experience & Design
, and
Engineering Enablement
.
Internal Custom Development
​
"I want to build a custom solution with my dev team."
This is a full-stack build scenario. The architecture provides DevX services, platforms, and API enablement to empower
internal teams. These efforts typically draw from
Engineering Enablement
,
Cloud & Infrastructure
, and
Observability & Reliability
.
Third-Party Integration
​
"A partner needs to use our identity, AE checking, and consent models."
This is a governance-heavy integration. The architecture supports it through secure APIs, workflow orchestration, and
business services. These needs intersect with
Cybersecurity
,
Cloud & Infrastructure
, and
Business
Enablement
—ensuring compliance, control, and auditability.
Tech Positioning
​
Tech positioning is the strategic process of aligning technology (including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, tools, accelerators,
components, and features) with Lilly’s goals and business needs. This ensures that every technology investment supports
broader objectives, such as enhancing customer experience, improving operational efficiency, and driving innovation.
Technology Classifications
We use the following
technology classifications
to describe the maturity, adoption, and strategic relevance of
technologies in Tech@Lilly:
Emerging
– Technologies or capabilities in the early stages of exploration and experimentation. These are
typically undergoing
proof-of-value
,
pilot programs
, or
viability testing
to assess potential business impact
and feasibility.
Specialized
– Solutions that are
tailored to specific use cases
, departments, or business units. They are
not
broadly adopted
across the enterprise but deliver high value in their niche applications.
Standard
– Technologies or capabilities that are
approved for enterprise-wide use
. They are
well-supported,
stable, and scalable
, with established governance, documentation, and integration patterns.
Strategic
– Foundational technologies or platforms that are
critical to the enterprise’s long-term strategy
and operations
. These receive
ongoing investment
, are
deeply embedded
in business processes, and are
central to
innovation, scalability, and resilience
.
Declining
– Technologies or capabilities that are
no longer aligned with strategic direction
. Investment is
being reduced, and a
retirement or replacement plan
is being developed or considered.
Retiring
– Solutions that are in the
active process of being phased out
. Replacement technologies have been
identified, and
migration or decommissioning efforts
are underway.
Exited
– Technologies or capabilities that have been
fully retired
. They are
no longer supported, approved, or
in use
within the enterprise environment.
Prohibited
– Technologies or practices that are
explicitly blocked or restricted
due to
substantial risk
,
compliance issues
, or a
formal enterprise architecture decision
. Use is not permitted under any circumstances.
Tech positioning plays a key role in optimizing our technology landscape, mitigate risks, and minimizing the cost of
change. It is designed for architects and technical leaders responsible for delivering products and solutions and for
aligning technology with strategic business goals.
