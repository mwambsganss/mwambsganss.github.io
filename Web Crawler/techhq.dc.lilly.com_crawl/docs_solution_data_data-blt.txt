Use if cost, data on AWS, simple visualizations and tight integration with AWS services are main considerations.
Use Cases
​
Create visualization dashboards  using different chart options, Compelling story telling using data from different AWS data stores, Use this tool if simple visualization is main objective, This tool is not suitable if you have requirements to do complex calculations by merging data from different data sources and data modeling, This tool is not suitable if you have a requirements to collaborate using Microsoft Teams
Notes
​
Cost effective tool to create visualizations if you have data on AWS.  If complex calculations and more visualizations features required, consider Power BI or Tableau. This is a great  tool to visualize large dataset in AWS.

Notes
​
Role Based license rquirement - Viewer (for end users) & Creator (for Dekstop Users). This tool is expensive than Power BI and QuickSight. Recommendation is to start with QuickSight if you have data on AWS and need to create simple dashboards/Visualizations. All other use cases,  consider Power BI. If both Power BI and QuickSight cannot meet the requirements, Tableau can be considered.
