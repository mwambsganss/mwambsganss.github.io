Overview
​
This document outlines the Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers planned for Lilly systems. These MCP servers will enable AI agents to access various Lilly tools and resources, with a particular focus on resource provisioning capabilities. The Lilly Cloud MCP server specifically could be used in the Agentic AI registry project to help provision resources.
MCP Servers
​
The following MCP servers are planned or under consideration:
Lilly Cloud MCP
: Resource provisioning for cloud infrastructure
Cortex Docs MCP
: Access to Cortex documentation
CATS MCP
: Internal application deployment (built)
GitHub MCP
: Code repository access
Lilly Flow MCP
: Workflow automation
Lilly Kubed MCP
: External application deployment (hanger- built)
LDS MCP
: Data services access

Lilly Cloud MCP and Agentic AI Registry
​
The Lilly Cloud MCP server could be utilized within the Agentic AI registry project specifically for resource provisioning capabilities.
Implementation Considerations
​
Reusable Components
: Identify common authentication, logging, and monitoring components that can be shared across MCP servers
Build vs. Configure
: Determine which components need custom development versus configuration of existing tools
Integration Points
: Define how these MCP servers will connect with various Lilly systems
Next Steps
​
Create detailed specifications for each MCP server
Prioritize development based on business impact
Develop a phased implementation plan
Establish governance and security standards
