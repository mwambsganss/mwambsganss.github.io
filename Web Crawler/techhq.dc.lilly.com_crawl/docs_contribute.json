In our case, we follow an\ninner source\napproach, where everyone is\nencouraged to share, improve, and build together across teams.\nWhat should you put on TechHQ?\nTechnical guidance on TechHQ should be sufficiently complete to aid architects and detailed enough for AI usage. To keep\nour technical knowledge DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), avoid repeating content already published elsewhere; instead, link\nto important external resources.\nSolution Guide Contributions\n​\nSolution guides are now synced daily from Stack Overflow articles.\nTo contribute:\nSign up to own a guide in our\nTechHQ Solution Guides spreadsheet\n, which is on our\nTechHQ Teams site\n.\nUse the\nTechHQ Solution Guide Drafter\n(Copilot AI) to start your first draft.\nMost TechHQ Solution Guides have a Use Case / Technology table;\nContainer Services\nis a good example. Other guides are\nsimply a high-level overview of what architects should know, such as\nResiliency & Disaster Recovery​\n.\nCopy the draft markdown into a\nnew Stack Overflow article\n.\nFor consistency, prefix the guide name with 🧭, and be sure to use the INFO block at the top, as seen in the\nSolution Guide Template\n.\nAdd three tags to the article:\ntechhq\n,\nsolution-guide\n, and one the following:\nai\n- Guidance for generative AI\nand LLMs\nbusiness-enablement\n-\nGuidance for our line-of-business platforms and capabilities, e.g. clinical operations, regulatory, manufacturing,\nsupply chain, commercial\ncloud\n- Guidance for cloud\n(public, private, IaaS, PaaS, & SaaS)\ncybersecurity\n- Guidance for\ncybersecurity, information security, and security best practices\ndata\n- Guidance for data to\ninsights guides, analytics, databases, and data science\nsoftware-engineering\n-\nGuidance for CI/CD, automation, infrastructure as code, and deployment practices\nobservability\n-\nGuidance for monitoring, logging, tracing, and application performance management\nproductivity\n-\nGuidance for tools and practices that enhance individual and team efficiency\nux\n- Guidance for user\nexperience design, usability, accessibility, and interface best practices\nYour solution guide article will be automatically be organized into TechHQ.\nSource Code Contributions\n​\nMinor, individual file edits\ncan be made directly to the dev branch. These edits will be automatically deployed to\nhttps://techhq-d.dc.lilly.com\n.\nAll edits\nwill be reviewed prior to prod deployments. Reviewers will vary based on\nthe change. Commit messages must capture the change rationale.\nFor new docs drafts and multi-doc edits\n, create a branch with the prefix\ndraft/\n. Open a PR to dev when ready.\nFor new site features\n, create a branch with the prefix\nfeatures/\n. Open a PR to dev when ready.\nNeither draft/ nor feature/ branches are automatically deployed. 'Automatically delete head branches' is not enabled;\ndelete your branch if it is complete or inactive.\nRunning TechHQ Locally\n​\nPrerequisites\n​\nNode.js\npnpm\nDevelopment Builds\n​\nThe dev server automatically reflects most changes without restart.\n# build & run dev\npnpm install\npnpm dev\n# refresh content from Stack Overflow\npnpm stackoverflow-sync\n# lint & typecheck your code!\npnpm eslint\npnpm tsc\nProduction Testing\n​\nThe prod server has indexed search and caching for performance.\npnpm install\npnpm build\npnpm serve\nWas this helpful?\nEdit this page\nNext\n📝 Markdown Extensions\nSolution Guide Contributions\nSource Code Contributions\nRunning TechHQ Locally\nPrerequisites\nDevelopment Builds\nProduction Testing\nCommunity\nEBA Viva Engage\nEBA SharePoint\nQuestions?\nReach us on Viva Engage!\nCopyright © 2026 Eli Lilly and Company",
