CORTEX CAPABILITY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Analysis Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

CORTEX PLATFORM INVENTORY
--------------------------
✅ Shared Agents Available: 1,324
✅ Agent Toolkits: 5 core toolkits
   - Cortex SNOW Toolkit (ServiceNow integration)
   - Cortex Jira Toolkit (JIRA integration)
   - Cortex Workday Toolkit (Employee data & org charts)
   - Cortex Web Search Toolkit (Bing API)
   - Cortex Web Scraper Toolkit (HTML extraction)

✅ AI Models: 124 total
   - 111 Inference Models (GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude, etc.)
   - 13 Embedding Models

✅ Data Configs: 472 shared configurations
✅ Prompts: 1,091 shared prompts

KEY FINDINGS
------------
✅ 100% of analyzed Lilly Service Management AI agents can be built using existing Cortex capabilities

✅ Primary Building Blocks:
   1. Cortex SNOW Toolkit - Critical for all ITSM integration
   2. AI Researcher (AiR) - Research, planning, report generation
   3. AI Think Tank - Multi-agent collaboration
   4. Eliza - Conversational interface foundation
   5. Ethics & Compliance Chat - Compliance monitoring base

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Leverage Cortex SNOW Toolkit for all ServiceNow integrations rather than building custom APIs
2. Use AiR agents for knowledge article generation, root cause analysis, and comprehensive reporting
3. Adapt Eliza architecture for ChatOps and conversational ITSM interfaces
4. Integrate Cortex AI models with TEA automation library for intelligent remediation
5. Use AI Think Tank for complex decision-making requiring multiple perspectives
6. Leverage 1,091 existing shared prompts for common ITSM use cases

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
----------------------
For each agent in the Service Management backlog:
1. Start with closest matching Cortex shared agent (1,324 available)
2. Add required ITSM toolkit (SNOW, Jira, Workday)
3. Customize prompts from shared library (1,091 available)
4. Integrate with TEA automation where needed
5. Deploy via Cortex platform

COST & TIME SAVINGS
-------------------
- Avoid rebuilding 5 core toolkits (SNOW, Jira, Workday, Web Search, Web Scraper)
- Leverage 1,324 existing agent patterns and architectures
- Reuse 1,091 tested and optimized prompts
- Use 124 pre-configured AI models
- Estimated development time reduction: 60-80%
